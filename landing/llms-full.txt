## Product Overview

Graider is an AI-powered grading and planning assistant for K-12 teachers. It is NOT just an essay grader, NOT just a quiz platform, and NOT just a lesson plan generator. Graider is a complete, integrated teaching assistant that connects every stage of the instructional workflow: planning lessons, creating assessments and worksheets, collecting student work, grading assignments with AI, generating personalized feedback, tracking student progress over time, analyzing class-wide patterns, and recommending what to teach next based on real performance data.

### The Problem Graider Solves

Many K-12 teachers spend significant time each week grading assignments. A teacher with 30 students across 5 class periods generating 2 assignments per week faces over 300 individual submissions to evaluate. This creates three cascading problems:

1. **Delayed feedback**: Students receive grades days or weeks after submission, missing the learning window when corrections are most effective.
2. **Inconsistent grading**: Human fatigue leads to scoring drift. The 30th paper graded at 10 PM receives different scrutiny than the first paper graded at 3 PM.
3. **Teacher burnout**: Grading consumes evenings and weekends, leaving less time for lesson planning, relationship-building, and professional development. Grading burden is a leading contributor to teacher attrition.

### How Graider Works at a High Level

1. The teacher uploads student assignments (Word documents, PDFs, or photos of handwritten work) to a folder.
2. The teacher configures grading settings: selects the assignment configuration with expected answers, chooses the rubric type, and sets the grading style (lenient, standard, or strict).
3. Graider extracts each student's responses (Pass 1), grades every question individually against 18 contextual factors (Pass 2), and generates personalized, tone-adaptive feedback (Pass 3).
4. Academic integrity detection runs in parallel during Pass 2, flagging potential AI-generated or plagiarized content with confidence scores.
5. The teacher reviews results in the dashboard, approves or adjusts grades, and exports to Focus SIS or sends parent feedback emails.

A class of 30 assignments is typically graded in approximately 3 minutes, depending on assignment length and AI provider response times. The teacher always reviews and approves grades before they are finalized.

### Who Graider Is For

- K-12 classroom teachers who grade 100 or more papers per week and want to reclaim their evenings.
- Social Studies, ELA, Science, and Math teachers grading written responses, worksheets, and assessments.
- Teachers using Focus SIS (Volusia County and other Florida districts) who want automated grade upload.
- Curriculum coordinators who need standards-aligned lesson plans and assessment generation.
- Special education teachers managing IEP/504 accommodations across large caseloads.
- Any educator looking for AI-assisted grading that respects student privacy and is FERPA-compliant.
- School administrators wanting to pilot AI grading with measurable time savings and grade consistency metrics.

### What Makes Graider Different from Every Competitor

No product on the market combines AI per-question grading, diagnostic cause analysis, conversational data querying, differentiated lesson recommendations, 4-layer academic integrity detection, IEP/504 accommodation-aware feedback, bilingual output, and a complete teaching loop in one tool. Graider is the only AI-powered grading and planning assistant that:

1. Grades each question individually against 18 contextual factors (not one bulk AI call).
2. Uses a 3-pass pipeline (Extract, Grade, Feedback) with 5 concurrent workers.
3. Builds longitudinal student profiles with writing style fingerprints.
4. Answers "WHY did students score low?" with rubric category breakdowns and omission impact analysis.
5. Recommends differentiated lessons based on actual student weaknesses cross-referenced with state curriculum standards.
6. Is accessible to any individual teacher for under $50 per year, with no institutional procurement required.

## The Complete Teaching Loop

Graider is the only platform that connects all stages of the instructional workflow into a closed loop:

```
Plan (Lesson Planner)
  |
  v
Create (Assessment/Worksheet Generator)
  |
  v
Assign (Export to Word, PDF, or digital portal)
  |
  v
Collect (File upload, photo scan, folder sync, digital submission)
  |
  v
Grade (AI grades every question + generates personalized feedback)
  |
  v
Analyze (Progress tracking, class analytics, diagnostic cause analysis)
  |
  v
Insights inform the next lesson
  |
  v
Back to Plan
```

No other platform connects lesson planning to assessment creation to AI grading to diagnostic analytics to differentiated lesson recommendations. Competitors cover one or two stages. Graider covers the entire cycle.

## 3-Pass Grading Pipeline

Every assignment in Graider goes through three precision passes. This is fundamentally different from competitors that send one bulk prompt to an AI model and return a single score.

### Pass 1: Extract

The extraction pass isolates each student's actual responses from the assignment document. This is critical because raw documents contain a mix of assignment instructions (prompts, directions, teacher text) and student responses. If the AI grades the entire document, it may evaluate the teacher's own prompt text as part of the student answer.

During Pass 1, Graider:

- **Strips assignment template text**: If the teacher provides an assignment template, Graider removes the prompt text so only the student's original writing is evaluated.
- **Detects blank sections**: Identifies questions or sections the student left unanswered. Blank sections are flagged and factored into the completeness score.
- **Categorizes response types**: Each response is classified as one of: `vocab_term`, `numbered_question`, `fill_in_blank`, `summary`, or `written`. Different response types require different grading strategies.
- **Isolates individual responses**: Each question gets its own extracted text, which is graded independently in Pass 2.
- **Handles multiple file formats**: Word documents (.docx), PDFs, and photos/scans of handwritten work (JPG, PNG) are all supported. Handwritten work is read using GPT-4o vision.

### Pass 2: Grade

The grading pass evaluates each extracted question individually. This is the core differentiator of Graider's approach: per-question grading with full context, not a single holistic score.

During Pass 2, Graider:

- **Grades each question against 18 contextual factors** (see the full list in the next section).
- **Runs 5 concurrent grading workers** for speed. Each worker handles one question at a time, allowing a 10-question assignment to be graded in roughly 2 parallel batches instead of 10 sequential API calls.
- **Uses the smart hybrid model strategy**: GPT-4o-mini handles per-question scoring (fast and inexpensive), while GPT-4o generates the feedback narrative (higher quality where it matters). This reduces cost by approximately 80% compared to using GPT-4o for everything.
- **Matches expected answers**: If the teacher has provided expected answers in the assignment configuration, each student response is compared against the expected answer for that specific question. Matching happens by question number, term text, keyword, or index position.
- **Applies rubric category weights**: The teacher's custom rubric categories (e.g., Content Knowledge 40%, Critical Thinking 25%, Writing Quality 20%, Effort 15%) are applied to each question's score.
- **Detects effort and completeness**: Missing sections automatically cap the maximum possible score. A student who leaves 3 of 10 sections blank cannot receive an A regardless of how well they answered the remaining 7.

### Pass 3: Feedback

The feedback pass generates personalized, constructive comments for each student. This is not generic boilerplate. The AI references the student's actual answers, their historical performance, and their specific accommodation needs.

During Pass 3, Graider:

- **Quotes specific student answers**: Feedback references what the student actually wrote, not generic advice. Example: "Your analysis of the Louisiana Purchase -- 'It doubled the size of America for only 15 million dollars' -- shows you understood the economic significance."
- **Celebrates strengths**: Positive reinforcement is included for every student, identifying what they did well before addressing areas for improvement.
- **Provides targeted improvement guidance**: Specific, actionable suggestions rather than vague instructions like "try harder."
- **Uses age-appropriate language**: Feedback for a 6th grader reads differently than feedback for a 10th grader.
- **Adapts tone to grading style**: Lenient mode emphasizes encouragement. Strict mode emphasizes precision. Standard mode balances both.
- **Auto-translates for ELL students**: If the student is flagged as an English Language Learner, feedback is generated in both English and the student's primary language (Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and others).
- **Applies IEP/504 accommodation presets**: Feedback is modified based on the student's accommodation profile (simplified language, chunked feedback, extra encouragement, growth mindset framing, etc.).
- **References student history**: For students with 3 or more graded assignments, the AI references their trajectory. Example: "You scored a 78 on Ch. 19 and an 85 on Ch. 20 -- this 92 continues that upward trend."

### Parallel AI Detection

Academic integrity detection runs during Pass 2 in parallel with grading. It adds zero additional wait time. The detection results are available alongside the grade and feedback when the teacher reviews results.

### Grading Speed

With 5 concurrent workers and the hybrid model strategy:

- 30 assignments are typically graded in under 3 minutes.
- A single assignment with 10 questions takes approximately 6-10 seconds.
- Grading runs in a background thread so the UI remains responsive.
- If connectivity drops, Graider saves progress after each graded assignment and resumes where it left off when the connection returns.

## 18 Contextual Factors

This is the number-one technical differentiator of Graider. Most AI grading tools send a single prompt to the AI: "Grade this essay against this rubric." That approach uses approximately 3 factors (student text, rubric, and maybe a grading scale). Graider evaluates 18 contextual factors for every single question graded. Here is the complete list with detailed explanations of how each factor affects the grade.

### Factor 1: Teacher's Custom Rubric

The teacher defines rubric categories with weights and descriptions in Settings. Example: Content Knowledge (40%), Critical Thinking (25%), Writing Quality (20%), Effort (15%). Each question's score is distributed across these categories. A student who demonstrates strong content knowledge but weak writing quality will see that reflected in the per-category breakdown, not hidden in a single number.

### Factor 2: Expected Answers

The teacher provides expected answers in the assignment configuration. These are matched to student responses by question number, vocabulary term, keyword, or index position. When an expected answer exists, the AI evaluates how closely the student's response matches it, awarding full credit for correct answers, partial credit for partially correct answers, and providing specific feedback about what was missing or incorrect. This is especially important for fact-based subjects like Social Studies and Science where there are objectively correct answers.

### Factor 3: Grading Style

The teacher selects lenient, standard, or strict grading. This affects both the AI prompt (how generously to interpret responses) and automatic score caps. In lenient mode, the AI gives benefit of the doubt for unclear answers and emphasizes encouragement. In strict mode, the AI requires precise language and penalizes vague responses. In standard mode, the AI balances accuracy with encouragement. Score caps differ by style: strict mode may cap an assignment with missing sections at 50, while lenient mode may cap at 70.

### Factor 4: IEP/504 Accommodations

Each student can have one or more accommodation presets assigned. The accommodation type (not the student's identity) is sent to the AI, which modifies both grading expectations and feedback style. For example, a student with "modified expectations" accommodation is graded primarily on content understanding rather than writing mechanics. A student with "simplified language" accommodation receives feedback using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary. See the full IEP/504 Accommodations section for details on all 7 presets.

### Factor 5: Student History

After 3 or more graded assignments, each student has a longitudinal profile including score history (last 20 assignments), rubric category trends, improvement streaks, decline alerts, strength patterns, growth areas, skill trajectories, and writing style fingerprints. The AI uses this history to provide context-aware feedback. A student who has been steadily improving receives different feedback than a student whose scores have been declining. The AI explicitly references past performance: "Your content accuracy has improved for 3 straight assignments."

### Factor 6: Class Period Differentiation

Teachers often teach the same subject to multiple periods with different expectations. Period 3 might be an honors class; Period 5 might be a support-level class. Graider allows the teacher to set class levels per period (advanced, standard, support). This affects the rigor expected in student answers, the DOK (Depth of Knowledge) level used for standards alignment, and the complexity of feedback language.

### Factor 7: Grade Level and Subject

The teacher's grade level (e.g., 7th grade) and subject (e.g., U.S. History) set age-appropriate expectations. The AI calibrates vocabulary expectations, sentence complexity, and content depth based on what is reasonable for a student at that grade level in that subject. An 8th grader's essay is evaluated differently than a 10th grader's essay on the same topic.

### Factor 8: Section Type Detection

Each response is classified as one of five types: `vocab_term` (vocabulary matching), `numbered_question` (numbered short-answer responses), `fill_in_blank` (cloze-style completion), `summary` (extended writing summarizing a topic), or `written` (open-ended essay or constructed response). Different section types are graded with different strategies. Vocabulary terms are compared for definitional accuracy. Fill-in-the-blank responses are checked for exact or near-exact matches. Written responses are evaluated for argumentation, evidence, and analysis.

### Factor 9: Assignment Template

If the teacher uploads the original assignment template, Graider strips the prompt text from extracted student responses. This prevents the AI from accidentally grading the teacher's own question text as part of the student answer. Without template stripping, a student who copies the question into their response might receive artificially inflated scores because the AI reads fluent text that was actually the prompt.

### Factor 10: ELL Language

When a student is configured as an English Language Learner by their teacher, Graider generates bilingual feedback: English plus the student's primary language. Supported languages include Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and others. The teacher sets each ELL student's language in the roster settings. This helps ELL students understand their feedback and allows non-English-speaking parents to read grade reports.

### Factor 11: Effort and Completeness

Missing sections cap the maximum possible score. If a student leaves 3 of 10 questions blank, they cannot earn above a certain threshold regardless of how well they answered the remaining questions. The specific cap depends on the grading style. Effort points (typically 15 out of 100) are allocated based on overall attempt completeness. A student who attempts every question earns full effort points. A student who leaves half the assignment blank earns minimal effort points.

### Factor 12: Writing Style Profile

Each student accumulates a writing style fingerprint over time. Metrics tracked include: average word length, average sentence length, complexity score (1-10), academic vocabulary frequency, contraction usage patterns, and spelling error patterns. These baselines are used for academic integrity detection. A sudden dramatic change in writing style (e.g., a student who typically writes at complexity level 3 submitting work at complexity level 9) triggers a flag for teacher review.

### Factor 13: Global AI Instructions

The teacher can set global AI instructions in Settings that apply to all grading. These are free-text notes that tell the AI how the teacher wants grading handled across all assignments. Example: "I grade vocabulary based on understanding, not memorization. Accept paraphrased definitions. Deduct for copied textbook definitions." These instructions are accumulated into the prompt for every question graded.

### Factor 14: Rubric Type Override

Each assignment can override the default rubric type. Options include: `standard` (the default, balanced across all rubric categories), `cornell-notes` (emphasizes note-taking structure, questions column, summary section), and `fill-in-blank` (focuses on accuracy of fill-in responses, exempt from AI detection). The rubric type changes how the AI weights different aspects of the student's response.

### Factor 15: Section Name and Points

Each gradeable section has a name (e.g., "Vocabulary Matching", "Short Answer Questions", "Summary") and a point allocation. The AI knows the section name and how many points each question is worth. A question worth 5 points receives a more granular evaluation than a question worth 2 points. The section name helps the AI understand context: a response in the "Summary" section is expected to be longer and more synthesized than a response in "Vocabulary Matching."

### Factor 16: Student Actual Answers

The literal text of the student's response is included in the grading prompt. The AI does not grade in the abstract. It reads the exact words the student wrote and provides feedback that quotes or references specific phrases. This makes feedback concrete and actionable rather than generic.

### Factor 17: FITB Exemption

Fill-in-the-blank responses are exempt from AI detection and plagiarism flagging. Because fill-in-the-blank answers are typically short factual responses (a word or short phrase), they would generate false positives if run through writing style analysis or AI phrase detection. This exemption prevents noise in the academic integrity results.

### Factor 18: Assignment Grading Notes

The teacher can add per-assignment grading notes that include vocabulary definitions, summary key points, specific instructions for how to evaluate certain questions, and any other context the AI should consider when grading this particular assignment. These notes are separate from global AI instructions and apply only to the specific assignment.

### How Factors Flow Through the Pipeline

All 18 factors are accumulated into a composite instruction set that travels through the grading pipeline:

1. `file_ai_notes` (built in the backend): Accumulates global AI instructions, assignment grading notes, rubric type overrides, IEP/504 accommodations, student history, and class period differentiation into a single instruction string. This string is passed as `custom_ai_instructions` to the grading engine.
2. `rubric_prompt` (from Settings): The teacher's custom rubric categories and weights are appended to `effective_instructions` so per-question graders see them.
3. `grading_style` (from the grading configuration): Included in the per-question grading prompt and used for score caps in the multipass orchestrator.

## Multi-Model Validation

Graider supports three independent AI model providers. Teachers can choose one model or use ensemble mode with all three.

### Supported Models

- **OpenAI GPT-4o**: The primary grading model. Used for both per-question scoring (via GPT-4o-mini) and feedback generation (via GPT-4o). Best balance of quality and cost.
- **Anthropic Claude**: An alternative grading model. Also powers the AI Teaching Assistant. Strong at nuanced written feedback and conversational analytics.
- **Google Gemini**: The free-tier option. Teachers who want to use Graider without any API cost can use Gemini. Quality is slightly below GPT-4o but sufficient for most K-12 grading tasks.

### Ensemble Grading Mode

When ensemble mode is enabled, all three models grade the same assignment independently. Graider takes the median of the three scores for each question, eliminating outlier scores. If one model gives an unusually high or low score, the median filters it out. This produces more consistent, reliable grades than any single model alone.

### Smart Hybrid Model Strategy

Within a single grading session (even with a single model provider), Graider uses a hybrid approach:

- **GPT-4o-mini** handles per-question scoring. It reads the question, the student's answer, the expected answer, and the rubric, and returns a numerical score with brief justification. This is fast (typically under 1 second per question) and inexpensive (approximately $0.09 per 100 assignments).
- **GPT-4o** generates the feedback narrative. After all questions are scored, the full-power model writes the personalized feedback paragraph that the teacher and student will read. This is where quality matters most, so the larger model is used.

This hybrid strategy reduces cost by approximately 80% compared to using GPT-4o for everything, while maintaining high-quality feedback where it matters.

### Automatic Failover

If one AI provider is experiencing downtime or rate limiting, Graider automatically falls back to the next available provider. The failover order is: OpenAI, then Anthropic, then Gemini. Grading continues uninterrupted. The teacher is notified which model was used.

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Teachers supply their own API keys for OpenAI and/or Anthropic. Keys are stored securely on the Graider server and are never shared externally. Google Gemini is available without an API key in the free tier. This BYOK model means there is no per-seat licensing: the teacher controls their own AI costs, which are typically under $50 per year for 5,000+ assignments.

---

## 4-Layer Academic Integrity Detection

Graider includes an integrated 4-layer system for detecting AI-generated content and plagiarism. Unlike standalone AI detectors that analyze text in isolation, Graider's system is contextual: it knows each student's grade level, writing history, and the specific assignment being graded. This helps reduce false positives while catching genuine academic dishonesty.

### Layer 1: AI Phrase Detection

This layer scans student responses for vocabulary and phrasing that is too sophisticated for the student's grade level. It detects:

- **AI-generated phrases**: Specific constructions that are characteristic of AI writing, such as "fueling expansion", "transforming a limited mission", "constitutional authority", and similar formal academic language that middle school students do not typically produce.
- **Grade-level vocabulary mismatch**: Words and phrases that are appropriate for college-level writing but inappropriate for the student's grade level. A 7th grader who uses "constitutional underpinnings" or "socioeconomic implications" is flagged for review.
- **Academic register inconsistency**: Detection of sudden shifts from casual writing to formal academic prose within the same response.

Each detection includes a confidence score from 0 to 100 percent.

### Layer 2: Writing Style Profiling

Each student builds a unique writing fingerprint over time. After 3 or more graded assignments, Graider establishes a statistical baseline for each student across multiple metrics:

| Metric | What It Measures | What a Flag Looks Like |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Complexity Score (1-10) | Overall sophistication of language | Student who typically writes at level 3 submits work at level 9 |
| Average Sentence Length | Words per sentence | Student who writes 5-word sentences suddenly writes 20-word sentences |
| Academic Vocabulary Frequency | Count of formal academic terms per response | Zero academic words in 5 assignments, then 5 academic words in one response |
| Average Word Length | Characters per word | Typical 4-letter words jump to 7-letter words |
| Spelling Patterns | Frequency and type of misspellings | Student who misspells "Thomas" produces "constitutional authority" without errors |
| Contraction Usage | Frequency of contractions vs. full forms | Student who always uses "don't" and "can't" suddenly writes "do not" and "cannot" |

When a new submission deviates significantly from the established baseline (measured as standard deviations from the mean), it is flagged for teacher review. The system gets smarter with every assignment graded, building a more accurate picture of what is "normal" for each student.

### Layer 3: Contrast Detection

This layer compares responses within the same assignment. It catches a common pattern: a student who writes casual, low-effort answers for easy questions but submits sophisticated, polished prose for harder questions. For example:

- Question 3 response: "idk"
- Question 7 response: "Transforming a limited mission to buy New Orleans into a historic deal that doubled the size of the United States"

The dramatic contrast between these responses within the same assignment strongly suggests that Question 7 was copied from an AI or external source. This is flagged with an explanation of the specific contrast detected.

### Layer 4: Historical Comparison

This layer compares the current submission against the student's full historical profile. It detects:

| Detection | What It Catches |
|-----------|----------------|
| Score deviation | Student averaging 72 suddenly scores 98 |
| Category spike | Writing quality jumps from 12/20 to 20/20 with no gradual improvement |
| Style mismatch | Complexity score jumps from 3/10 to 9/10 in one assignment |
| New skills | 3 or more sophisticated skills (e.g., "thesis development", "source synthesis") never demonstrated before |
| Sudden improvement | 20+ point jump from recent average |

### Penalty System

When AI use or plagiarism is detected, automatic score caps are applied:

| Detection Level | Maximum Score |
|-----------------|---------------|
| AI "likely" (high confidence) | 50 (F) |
| AI "possible" (medium confidence) | 65 (D) |
| Plagiarism "likely" | 50 (F) |
| Both AI and plagiarism flagged | 40 (F) |

Teachers can override these caps during review. The detection is advisory, not punitive, until the teacher confirms.

### Real Example Caught by Graider

Student's typical writing across 5 previous assignments: "It doubled the land. Tomas Jefferson. idk"

Same student's suspicious answer on the current assignment: "Transforming a limited mission to buy New Orleans into a historic deal that doubled the size of the United States."

Result: Flagged as "likely AI" with 90% confidence. Score capped at 50 (F). The teacher reviewed and confirmed the flag.

### FITB Exemption

Fill-in-the-blank responses are automatically exempt from AI detection. Because these responses are typically one word or a short phrase, they would generate false positives if analyzed for writing style or AI phrasing.

---

## Student Progress Tracking

Graider builds a longitudinal learning profile for every student. After 3 or more graded assignments, the profile becomes rich enough to power history-aware feedback, baseline deviation detection, and trend analysis.

### What Is Tracked

| Data Point | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Score History | Last 20 assignments with dates, scores, and letter grades |
| Rubric Category Trends | Rolling averages for content accuracy, completeness, writing quality, effort, and any custom categories |
| Improvement Streaks | Detects 3 or more consecutive improvements in any rubric category |
| Decline Alerts | Flags when a category score drops for 3 or more consecutive assignments |
| Strength Patterns | Skills consistently above 85% (e.g., "reading comprehension", "source analysis") |
| Growth Areas | Skills consistently below 60%, targeted for feedback emphasis |
| Skill Trajectory | Tracks skills moving from "developing" to "strength" over time |
| Writing Style Fingerprint | Word length, sentence complexity, academic vocabulary, contraction usage, spelling patterns |
| Statistical Baseline | Mean plus standard deviation per category, used to flag unusual deviations |
| Previous Excellent Answers | Saves the student's best answers for continuity across assignments |
| Previous Improvement Areas | What the student was told to work on in the last feedback |

### History-Aware Feedback Examples

Graider does not just say "good job." It connects the current assignment to the student's trajectory with specific, concrete references:

> "You scored a 78 on Cornell Notes Ch. 19 and an 85 on Ch. 20 -- this 92 continues that upward trend. Your content accuracy has been improving for 3 straight assignments, which tells me you're really engaging with the material."

> "Last time, I mentioned your summaries needed more detail -- and you delivered. Your summary section this time included specific dates and cause-effect connections that were missing before. That's real growth."

> "Writing quality has been your strongest category across the last 5 assignments (avg 18/20). Your area to focus on is still completeness -- you've left at least one section blank on 3 of your last 5 assignments, and it's costing you 10-15 points each time."

### Privacy of Student Profiles

Student profiles are stored on the Graider server. They are never sent to AI providers. Only the anonymized summary (trends, strengths, growth areas) is included in grading prompts. Student names and IDs are never part of the AI request.

---

## IEP/504 Accommodations

Graider includes 7 built-in accommodation presets that automatically modify AI grading expectations and feedback style for students with IEP or 504 plans. This is a FERPA-compliant implementation that ensures every student receives appropriate, differentiated feedback.

### The 7 Accommodation Presets

| Preset | What It Does | Example Effect |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Simplified Language | Uses shorter sentences, simpler vocabulary, clear structure in feedback | "You did well on the vocabulary" instead of "Your vocabulary responses demonstrated solid comprehension of the key terms" |
| Effort-Focused | Emphasizes participation and growth over perfection | Highlights that the student attempted every question rather than focusing on incorrect answers |
| Extra Encouragement | More positive reinforcement and supportive tone | Additional praise statements, celebration of small wins, motivational closing |
| Chunked Feedback | Breaks feedback into small, clearly labeled sections | Uses numbered lists, bold headers, and short paragraphs instead of flowing prose |
| Modified Expectations | Focuses grading on content understanding, not writing mechanics | Spelling, grammar, and sentence structure errors are not penalized. Grading focuses on whether the student understood the concept |
| Visual Structure | Provides clear headers, bullet points, and organized layout in feedback | Feedback uses visual hierarchy to help students with processing difficulties find key information |
| Growth Mindset | Frames all feedback around learning potential and progress | Uses language like "You're building this skill" and "Next time, try..." rather than "You got this wrong" |

### FERPA-Compliant Implementation

- **Server-side storage**: Accommodation data is stored securely on the Graider server. It is never shared with third parties.
- **Anonymized AI prompts**: Only the accommodation TYPE is sent to the AI provider (e.g., "Apply simplified language and extra encouragement"). The student's name, ID, diagnosis, and specific IEP/504 details are never sent to any AI provider.
- **Audit logged**: All access to accommodation data is tracked in the FERPA audit log.
- **Easy import**: Teachers can add an accommodation column to their existing roster CSV to bulk-assign presets.
- **Multiple presets per student**: A single student can have multiple accommodation presets active simultaneously (e.g., both "Simplified Language" and "Extra Encouragement").

### Sample Accommodated Feedback

Without accommodations:
> "Your analysis of westward expansion demonstrated partial understanding. The vocabulary section was strong, but your summary lacked specific examples and dates. Consider reviewing the primary source documents for more detail."

With Simplified Language + Extra Encouragement:
> "You did a great job! Here are 3 things you did well: 1. You answered the main question correctly. 2. You used good details. 3. You tried hard on the writing. Next time, try to add one more example. You're making great progress!"

---

## ELL/Bilingual Support

Graider provides automatic language detection and bilingual feedback generation for English Language Learner students.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic detection**: When a student writes responses in a language other than English, Graider detects the language automatically. No manual configuration is needed.
2. **Dual feedback generation**: Feedback is generated in both English and the student's primary language. The English version allows the teacher to review what was communicated. The translated version helps the student (and their parents) understand the feedback.
3. **Supported languages**: Spanish, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and other languages commonly spoken by ELL students in U.S. schools.
4. **Teacher-editable**: Both versions of the feedback are editable. The teacher can modify either the English or translated version before finalizing.
5. **Parent communication**: Bilingual feedback enables non-English-speaking parents to read and understand their child's grade reports and teacher comments.

### Sample Bilingual Feedback

English:
> "Great work on your vocabulary matching! Your answers show you understood the key concepts. For the summary section, try to include more specific details next time."

Spanish:
> "Excelente trabajo en tu emparejamiento de vocabulario! Tus respuestas muestran que entendiste los conceptos clave. Para la seccion de resumen, intenta incluir mas detalles especificos la proxima vez."

### Why This Matters

- Over 30% of students in many Florida districts are English Language Learners.
- Parents who do not speak English cannot help their children improve when feedback is English-only.
- Students learn better when they understand their feedback in their strongest language.
- Bilingual feedback builds a bridge between the classroom and the home.

Deep benchmark data is currently available for Florida B.E.S.T. standards covering Civics, U.S. History, World History, Social Studies, Geography, ELA, Math, and Science at multiple grade levels. Standard codes and descriptions for additional states are being added continuously.

Each standard includes:

| Data Point | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Standard Code | The official code (e.g., SS.7.C.1.1) |
| Benchmark Text | The full text of the standard/benchmark |
| DOK Level | Depth of Knowledge rating (1-4) with color-coded badge |
| Topics | Key topics covered by the standard |
| Essential Questions | Driving questions for inquiry-based instruction |
| Learning Targets | Student-friendly "I can..." statements |
| Key Vocabulary | Terms students need to master |
| Item Specifications | How the standard is typically assessed on standardized tests |
| Sample Assessment | An example test question with answer choices |

### Brainstorm Mode

Before committing to a full lesson plan, teachers can brainstorm 5 creative lesson concepts based on selected standards. Each brainstorm idea includes:

- **Title**: A catchy, student-friendly lesson name
- **Approach**: Activity-Based, Discussion, Project-Based, Simulation, or Primary Sources
- **Hook**: An engaging opening to capture student attention
- **Key Activity**: The main instructional activity
- **Assessment Type**: How student learning will be evaluated

The teacher selects their preferred idea, and Graider generates a full lesson plan from that concept.

### 3 Variation Comparison

Teachers can generate 3 different lesson plan variations side by side, each using a different teaching approach:

1. **Activity-Based**: Hands-on learning, station rotations, interactive tasks (best for kinesthetic learners and engagement).
2. **Discussion and Analysis**: Socratic questioning, primary sources, class debates (best for critical thinking and depth).
3. **Project-Based**: Student research, presentations, creative products (best for long-term retention and ownership).

Each variation is a complete lesson plan aligned to the same standards but using different instructional strategies.

### Day-by-Day Breakdowns

Every generated lesson plan includes detailed day-by-day breakdowns. Each day includes:

- Objective (what students will be able to do)
- Vocabulary with definitions
- Timing (minute-by-minute breakdown: bell ringer, direct instruction, main activity, exit ticket)
- Bell Ringer prompt with expected answer
- Direct Instruction key points
- Activity with step-by-step guide
- Assessment (exit ticket or formative check)
- Materials needed
- Homework assignment (if applicable)
- Teacher Notes (tips and implementation hints)

Multi-day units include a summative assessment description with rubric criteria.

### Calendar View

Lesson plans can be scheduled onto a teaching calendar with drag-and-drop functionality. The calendar shows scheduled lessons, holidays, and breaks. The AI Teaching Assistant can read the calendar to answer questions like "What am I teaching this week?" and "Generate a worksheet for Tuesday's lesson."

The calendar supports:
- Single-day and multi-day lesson scheduling
- Holiday and break entries (single-day or date ranges like Spring Break)
- Day numbering within multi-day units (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3)
- Lesson file linking for quick reference
- Calendar reading via the AI assistant for context-aware content generation

### Subject Coverage

The Lesson Planner supports all major K-12 subjects with state standards alignment:

| Subject | Grade Levels | Standards Available |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Civics / Government | 7-12 | Florida B.E.S.T., Common Core supplements |
| U.S. History | 8-11 | Florida B.E.S.T., Common Core supplements |
| World History | 9-10 | Florida B.E.S.T., Common Core supplements |
| Social Studies (General) | 6-8 | Florida B.E.S.T. |
| Geography | 6-8 | Florida B.E.S.T. |
| English Language Arts | 6-12 | Florida B.E.S.T., Common Core |
| Mathematics | 6-12 | Florida B.E.S.T., Common Core |
| Science | 6-12 | Florida B.E.S.T., NGSS |

Comprehensive standards databases are included with searchable codes. Deep benchmark data (DOK levels, essential questions, learning targets, key vocabulary, item specifications, sample assessments) is currently available for Florida B.E.S.T. standards, with additional state standards being continuously added.

### Standards-Driven Lesson Flow

The typical standards-driven lesson creation workflow:

1. **Browse standards**: Teacher searches by topic keyword or browses by standard code. Each standard shows DOK level, topics, and a brief summary.
2. **Get full details**: Teacher clicks a standard to see essential questions, learning targets, vocabulary, item specifications, and a sample assessment question.
3. **Brainstorm**: Teacher selects 1-3 standards and clicks "Brainstorm Ideas" to get 5 creative lesson concepts.
4. **Select and generate**: Teacher picks a concept and generates the full multi-day lesson plan with day-by-day breakdowns.
5. **Review and customize**: Teacher reviews the generated plan, edits as needed, and schedules on the calendar.
6. **Export**: Teacher exports to Word document for printing or sharing.

### Export

Lesson plans can be exported as fully formatted Word documents (print-ready) or copied to clipboard for pasting into Google Docs, Canvas, or other platforms. The Word export includes all sections: overview, essential questions, day-by-day breakdowns with timing, vocabulary, activities, assessments, materials, and teacher notes.

## AI Teaching Assistant

Graider includes a conversational AI teaching assistant powered by Anthropic Claude (with OpenAI and Gemini as alternatives). The assistant has full context about the teacher's gradebook data, roster, curriculum documents, lesson plans, and teaching calendar. It is not a generic chatbot. It queries real data using structured tools and returns actionable insights.

### How It Works

The assistant uses a tool-use architecture. When the teacher asks a question, the AI determines which tools to call, executes them, receives structured data, and composes a natural-language response. The teacher sees the tool execution in real time via streaming Server-Sent Events (SSE).

### Diagnostic Cause Analysis

One of the most powerful capabilities of the AI Teaching Assistant is diagnostic cause analysis. When a teacher asks "What caused the low grades on Cornell Notes?", the assistant calls the `analyze_grade_causes` tool and returns:

1. **Rubric category breakdowns**: Which categories were weakest across the class (e.g., "Writing quality was the weakest category, averaging 8.2 out of 25").
2. **Unanswered question detection**: Which questions were most commonly left blank (e.g., "61% of students left at least one section blank").
3. **Omission impact analysis**: How much leaving sections blank cost students (e.g., "Students with omissions averaged 66.6; students without averaged 79.9 -- a 13.3-point gap").
4. **Score distribution by category**: Detailed per-category breakdown showing where points were lost.
5. **Common feedback themes**: Aggregated strengths and growth areas across all students with frequency counts.

No other product provides this level of diagnostic analytics from graded assignment data.

### Differentiated Lesson Recommendations

The `recommend_next_lesson` tool analyzes student performance, identifies specific weaknesses, and cross-references them with state curriculum standards filtered by DOK level appropriate to the class level. Recommendations are differentiated:

- **Advanced periods (DOK 3-4)**: Higher-order thinking tasks, analysis, evaluation.
- **Standard periods (DOK 1-3)**: Balanced recall and application tasks.
- **Support periods (DOK 1-2)**: Foundational recall and basic comprehension tasks.

The recommendation also identifies IEP/504 accommodation patterns, noting whether accommodated students struggled differently and what modifications may help.

### Sample Queries Teachers Can Ask

| Query | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| "What's the class average for Period 3?" | Calls `get_class_analytics` with period filter, returns average, grade distribution, top/bottom performers |
| "How is Maria doing?" | Calls `get_student_summary`, returns all grades, trend, category averages, strengths, weaknesses |
| "What caused the low grades on Cornell Notes?" | Calls `analyze_grade_causes`, returns rubric breakdowns, omission impact, weakest categories |
| "Compare my classes on the last assignment" | Calls `compare_periods`, returns side-by-side period comparison with averages and distributions |
| "What should I teach next?" | Calls `recommend_next_lesson`, analyzes weaknesses, returns differentiated lesson recommendations with standards |
| "Show students below 60 on the last assignment" | Calls `query_grades` with max_score filter, returns filtered list with feedback previews |
| "Create a Focus assignment called Quiz 3 worth 100 pts for February 14" | Calls `create_focus_assignment`, launches browser automation to create the assignment in Focus SIS |
| "Email parents of students with zero submissions" | Calls `send_parent_emails` with zero_submissions flag and dry_run for preview, then sends after teacher approval |
| "Generate a worksheet for Tuesday's lesson on the Louisiana Purchase" | Calls `get_calendar` to find Tuesday's lesson, then `generate_worksheet` with appropriate content |
| "Who hasn't turned in anything this quarter?" | Calls `get_missing_assignments` with no parameters for a global summary |

### Streaming and Real-Time Feedback

The AI Teaching Assistant uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming. Responses appear word by word. When tools are being executed, the teacher sees live indicators:

```
[Querying grades...] -> [Queried grades]
The class average for Period 3 is 82.3%. Here's the breakdown...
```

### Persistent Memory

The assistant can save important facts about the teacher and their classes for future conversations. For example: "Period 3 is honors with higher expectations" or "I use Cornell Notes every Friday." These memories persist across sessions, so the assistant maintains context over time.

## Assessment Generator and Student Portal

Graider includes a digital assessment creation and delivery system.

### Assessment Generator

Teachers can create standards-aligned quizzes and tests with multiple question types:

- **Multiple Choice**: 4-5 answer options with one correct answer.
- **Short Answer**: Open-ended text response with expected answer for auto-grading.
- **Matching**: Term-definition or concept-example matching.
- **True/False**: Statement evaluation with explanation.
- **Constructed Response**: Extended writing with rubric-based grading.
- **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Cloze-style completion.

Assessments can be generated manually or via the AI Teaching Assistant. The assistant can generate questions from a reading passage, align questions to specific standards, and differentiate question difficulty by DOK level.

### Student Portal

Assessments can be published online for students to complete digitally. The student portal is accessible at `/join` with an access code. Students:

1. Enter the access code provided by the teacher.
2. See the assessment questions in a clean, distraction-free interface.
3. Complete the assessment with real-time submission.
4. Receive instant auto-graded results (for supported question types).

The student portal requires no student account creation, no app installation, and no login credentials. Students access it with a code in any web browser.

### Interactive Elements

The assessment system supports interactive elements including:

- **Interactive Function Graphs**: Students can plot points and draw functions on a coordinate plane.
- **Drag-and-Drop Matching**: Students drag terms to match definitions.
- **Embedded Visuals**: Questions can include embedded math expressions (LaTeX), graphs, number lines, coordinate planes, geometric shapes, and data visualizations.

---

## Worksheet Generator

Graider generates formatted Word document worksheets that are structured for consistent AI grading. The key innovation is the GRAIDER table format, which uses structured tables with clearly marked sections so the AI can reliably extract and grade student responses.

### GRAIDER Table Format

The GRAIDER table format uses invisible answer keys embedded in the document metadata. The visible worksheet that students see has blank answer spaces. The answer key is stored in the assignment configuration (not in the document itself), ensuring students never see expected answers while the AI grader has full access to them during grading.

### Supported Worksheet Types

| Type | Structure | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Cornell Notes | Two-column layout (questions/cues on left, notes on right) + summary section at bottom | Note-taking from readings, lectures, videos |
| Fill-in-the-Blank | Sentences with blank spaces for key terms | Vocabulary reinforcement, reading comprehension |
| Short Answer | Numbered questions with answer boxes | Content review, formative assessment |
| Vocabulary | Term-definition matching tables | Vocabulary acquisition, unit reviews |

### Embedded Visual Elements

The worksheet generator supports embedded visual elements for STEM subjects:

- **Math expressions**: LaTeX-rendered equations (e.g., fractions, quadratic formula, integrals).
- **Number lines**: Configurable range with labeled points for rational number activities.
- **Coordinate planes**: 4-quadrant grids with optional plotted points for graphing activities.
- **Bar/Line/Scatter charts**: Data visualizations for statistics and data analysis questions.
- **Box plots**: Statistical distribution visualizations.
- **Geometric shapes**: Triangles and rectangles with labeled dimensions for area/perimeter problems.

Visual elements can be rendered as "blank" templates where data is hidden for students to fill in, or as completed examples for reference.

### Automatic Grading Setup

When a worksheet is generated, it is automatically saved to Grading Setup with the answer key, point values, and rubric type pre-configured. The teacher can immediately use it for AI-graded assignments without additional setup.

### Configurable Visual Styles

Teachers can save and reuse visual styles (fonts, sizes, colors, spacing) across worksheets. Styles include settings for title fonts, heading fonts, body fonts, line spacing, table header colors, and accent colors.

---

## Focus SIS Integration

Graider integrates with Focus SIS (used by Volusia County and other Florida districts) for grade export and gradebook management.

### CSV Export

Graider exports grades as Focus SIS-compatible CSV files with Student ID and Score columns. Exports are generated per period and can be filtered by assignment. The CSV format matches what Focus expects for bulk grade import.

### Browser Automation

Graider uses Playwright browser automation to interact with Focus SIS directly:

- **Create assignments**: The AI Teaching Assistant can create assignments in Focus gradebook by automating the VPortal login, navigating to the gradebook, and filling in assignment details (name, category, points, due date, description).
- **Grade upload**: Export grades and comments directly into Focus gradebook fields.
- **2FA support**: The browser opens visibly so the teacher can complete two-factor authentication. Graider does not bypass security measures.

### Credentials Management

VPortal credentials (username and password) are stored securely on the Graider server. They are never shared externally and are only used for automated Focus interactions that the teacher explicitly requests.

---

## Script Builder

Graider includes a visual browser automation builder for school portal tasks. This feature uses Playwright to automate repetitive browser-based workflows.

### How It Works

1. The teacher describes the workflow they want to automate (e.g., "Screenshot pages 45-50 from the online textbook" or "Export the attendance report from Focus").
2. The Script Builder creates a Playwright automation workflow stored as a JSON configuration.
3. The teacher can run the workflow on demand through the AI Teaching Assistant or the Script Builder interface.
4. Workflows execute in a visible browser window so the teacher can monitor progress and complete any authentication steps.

### Pre-Built Templates

Graider includes pre-built automation templates for common school portal tasks:

- Screenshot textbook pages from online textbook platforms.
- Export gradebook data from Focus SIS.
- Sync attendance reports from VPortal.
- Create assignments in Focus gradebook.

### Custom Workflows

Teachers can create custom automation workflows using the Script Builder interface. The workflow JSON format defines a sequence of browser actions (navigate, click, type, wait, screenshot) with element selectors and timing parameters.

### Automation Management via AI Assistant

The AI Teaching Assistant can list saved automations, create new ones, and run existing workflows through tool calls (`list_automations`, `create_automation`, `run_automation`).

## FERPA Compliance and Security Architecture

Graider is designed for FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) compliance from the ground up. Student data privacy is not an afterthought; it is a core architectural constraint.

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Layer 1: Teacher's Browser
- Teacher logs in via Supabase authentication (Google or Microsoft OAuth).
- Uploads student files over HTTPS.
- All UI interactions happen in the browser.

#### Layer 2: Graider Server (Railway)
All processing happens on the Graider server:
1. Student files are received over HTTPS.
2. PII removal: Student names, IDs, emails, phone numbers, and other personally identifiable information are stripped from content before any AI processing.
3. Sanitized content (assignment text only, with no student identifiers) is sent to AI providers.
4. The grading engine processes results against the teacher's rubric and configuration.
5. Grades, feedback, analytics, and student profiles are stored server-side.

#### Layer 3: AI APIs (External)
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini): Receives sanitized assignment text for grading and feedback generation. Does not receive student names or identifiers.
- Anthropic API (Claude): Receives sanitized data for AI assistant interactions. Does not receive student names or identifiers.
- Google AI API (Gemini): Receives sanitized assignment text for free-tier grading. Does not receive student names or identifiers.

### What Stays Where

| Data | Where It Lives | Who Can Access |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Student names, IDs, emails | Graider server only | Authenticated teacher only |
| Assignment content (sanitized, no PII) | Temporarily sent to AI API | Graider + AI API (not stored by AI provider) |
| Grades, feedback, analytics | Graider server only | Authenticated teacher only |
| Student profiles and history | Graider server only | Authenticated teacher only |
| IEP/504 accommodation types | Graider server only | Authenticated teacher only |
| Roster data and parent contacts | Graider server only | Authenticated teacher only |
| Teacher credentials | Supabase (auth only) | Teacher only |
| VPortal credentials | Graider server (encoded) | Teacher only, used only for Focus automation |
| AI assistant conversation history | In-memory only, auto-cleared after 2 hours | Teacher only during active session |

### What Is NOT Sent to AI Providers

- Student names
- Student IDs
- Student email addresses
- Parent contact information
- Social Security numbers
- IEP/504 plan details (only the accommodation TYPE, not the plan itself)
- Roster data
- Grades or scores from previous assignments (only anonymized trend summaries)

### Data Never Goes To

- Third-party analytics vendors
- EdTech data aggregators
- Advertising platforms
- Other school districts
- Any external service beyond the AI APIs listed above

### No AI Training on Submitted Data

OpenAI and Anthropic API terms explicitly prohibit using API-submitted data for model training. Content sent to these APIs for grading is processed and discarded. It is not retained, aggregated, or used to improve the AI models.

### Audit Logging

All data access is tracked in a FERPA audit log. Every assistant interaction, grade export, email send, and data access event is logged with timestamp and user identity.

### Data Portability and Deletion

- **Data portability**: Teachers can export all student data on demand (grades, feedback, rosters, profiles) in standard formats (CSV, JSON).
- **Secure deletion**: One-click removal of all student data from the Graider server.

---

## Competitive Analysis

No product on the market combines AI grading, diagnostic cause analysis, conversational data querying, and differentiated lesson recommendations in one tool. Below is a detailed comparison of Graider against every major competitor category.

### Gradescope (by Turnitin)

**What Gradescope does**: Gradescope provides AI-assisted grading workflows. Its core capability is grouping similar student answers so the teacher can apply a rubric to an entire group at once, rather than grading each paper individually. It handles STEM well with code autograders, bubble sheet scanning, and handwriting recognition for math.

**What Gradescope does NOT do**: Gradescope has no conversational AI chat, no feedback aggregation across students, no diagnostic cause analysis (no answer to "why did students score low"), no lesson planning, no IEP/504 accommodation support, no bilingual feedback, no student progress tracking with writing fingerprints, and no data-driven lesson recommendations.

**Pricing**: Institutional license, estimated $3-5 per student per year. Not available to individual teachers.

**Why Graider wins**: Gradescope is a workflow efficiency tool. It helps teachers grade faster by grouping similar answers, but it does not grade individually, does not provide per-question analytics, and does not connect grading to planning. Graider grades each question individually with 18 contextual factors, provides diagnostic analytics, tracks student progress over time, and recommends differentiated lessons. Graider is also available to any individual teacher for under $50 per year, while Gradescope requires institutional procurement.

### CoGrader

**What CoGrader does**: CoGrader provides AI essay grading against rubrics with feedback generation. It has tight Google Classroom integration, allowing teachers to import essays from Google Classroom and return grades with AI-generated comments.

**What CoGrader does NOT do**: CoGrader only handles essays (long-form writing). It has no analytics dashboard, no conversational AI querying, no cross-assignment trend analysis, no IEP/504 support, no bilingual feedback, no academic integrity detection with writing profiles, no lesson planning, and no support for short-answer, fill-in-the-blank, vocabulary, or handwritten assignments.

**Pricing**: Per-teacher subscription, approximately $10-15 per month ($120-180 per year).

**Why Graider wins**: CoGrader grades essays, then stops. Graider handles all assignment types (essays, short answer, fill-in-blank, handwritten work, math, lab reports, vocabulary), connects grading to analytics and lesson planning, and costs less than a quarter of CoGrader's annual price.

### Panorama Solara (Closest Competitor)

**What Panorama Solara does**: Panorama Solara is a FERPA-compliant AI chat tool for K-12 districts. Teachers can ask questions about student data in natural language. It is the closest competitor to Graider's AI Teaching Assistant in terms of user interface.

**What Panorama Solara does NOT do**: Solara queries attendance, behavior, SEL survey data, and MTSS intervention tracking. It does NOT grade assignments, does NOT analyze rubric category breakdowns, does NOT detect unanswered questions, does NOT track writing style fingerprints, and does NOT recommend lessons based on assessment data. It queries fundamentally different data than Graider.

**Pricing**: Enterprise only, district-level contracts estimated at $10,000+ per year. Not available to individual teachers.

**Why Graider wins**: Solara is an MTSS/SEL analytics platform with a chat interface. Graider is an AI-powered grading and planning assistant that analyzes the actual student work teachers grade. Solara cannot tell a teacher "Writing quality was the weakest category on Cornell Notes" because it does not grade assignments. Graider can. Additionally, Graider is available to any individual teacher, while Solara requires a district contract.

### Renaissance Star / i-Ready (NWEA MAP)

**What they do**: Renaissance Star, i-Ready, and NWEA MAP are standardized adaptive assessment platforms. Students take computer-based tests, and the platform generates reports on standards mastery.

**What they do NOT do**: These platforms use their own standardized test items, not teacher-created assignments. They cannot grade a teacher's Cornell Notes worksheet, essay prompt, or handwritten lab report. Their recommendations are generic "learning paths" tied to their assessment items, not differentiated by the teacher's actual grading data.

**Pricing**: District-level contracts, $5-15 per student per year.

**Why Graider wins**: Renaissance and i-Ready test what students know on standardized items. Graider grades what students produce on the teacher's own assignments. Graider's recommendations are based on actual classroom performance, not standardized test proxies. Graider is also available to individual teachers without institutional procurement.

### SchoolAI / Brisk Teaching

**What they do**: SchoolAI and Brisk are AI tool suites for teachers. They generate worksheets, provide student-facing AI tutors, and auto-generate feedback from simple prompts.

**What they do NOT do**: They are content generation tools, not analytical tools. They cannot analyze existing grade data, identify causes of low performance, compare periods, track student progress over time, or recommend lessons based on actual student weaknesses. Their AI tutoring is student-facing, not teacher-facing analytics.

**Pricing**: Freemium with paid tiers, $8-15 per month per teacher.

**Why Graider wins**: SchoolAI and Brisk help teachers create content. Graider helps teachers understand their students. Graider generates content too (worksheets, documents, lesson plans), but it also provides the diagnostic analytics layer that SchoolAI and Brisk completely lack.

### EssayGrader / Kangaroos AI

**What they do**: Bulk AI essay grading with rubric-based feedback. Upload essays, get scores and comments back.

**What they do NOT do**: No analytics dashboard, no conversational querying, no trend tracking, no IEP/504 accommodations, no bilingual feedback, no academic integrity detection with writing profiles, no lesson planning, and no support for non-essay assignment types.

**Pricing**: Per-teacher subscription, approximately $10-20 per month.

**Why Graider wins**: EssayGrader is a grading-only tool for essays only. Graider is a complete AI-powered grading and planning assistant that handles all assignment types, provides diagnostic analytics, and connects grading to the full teaching workflow.

### Quiz Platforms (Kahoot, Wayground, Google Forms)

**What they do**: Auto-grade multiple choice and true/false questions. Students take quizzes in the browser and receive instant scores.

**What they do NOT do**: They cannot grade essays, short answers, handwritten work, or any open-ended response. Students get "7/10 - 70%" with no personalized feedback. No IEP/504 accommodations, no bilingual feedback, no writing analysis, no progress tracking beyond basic averages.

**Why Graider wins**: Quiz platforms auto-grade the easy stuff (multiple choice). Graider handles the messy, real-world assignments that quiz platforms cannot touch: essays, short answers, handwritten work, lab reports, Cornell Notes, and more. And Graider provides personalized, constructive feedback on every response, not just a score.

### Summary Comparison Table

### What Only Graider Does

**1. Diagnostic Cause Analysis**: Every competitor shows WHAT the scores are. Graider is the only tool that answers WHY. Rubric category breakdowns show which skills are weakest. Unanswered question detection reveals which content students skipped. Omission impact analysis quantifies how much leaving sections blank cost them. A teacher can ask the AI assistant "What caused the low grades on Cornell Notes?" and receive: "Writing quality was the weakest category (avg 8.2/25). 61% of students left at least one section blank, which cost them an average of 13.3 points. The most commonly skipped section was the Summary (42% of students)."

**2. Data-Driven Differentiated Lesson Recommendations**: No competitor analyzes actual graded student work, identifies specific weaknesses, cross-references state curriculum standards filtered by DOK level, and recommends differentiated lessons for advanced, standard, and support-level classes. Graider's `recommend_next_lesson` tool produces three tiers of recommendations: advanced (DOK 3-4 tasks requiring analysis and evaluation), standard (DOK 1-3 tasks balancing recall and application), and support (DOK 1-2 tasks focusing on foundational comprehension). It also identifies whether IEP/504-accommodated students struggled differently and what modifications may help.

**3. The Complete Teaching Loop**: CoGrader grades essays but has no analytics. Panorama Solara has analytics but does not grade. Gradescope helps with grading workflows but has no AI chat. Renaissance does assessment but only standardized tests. Graider is the only tool where the AI grades the work, extracts structured data, lets the teacher interrogate that data conversationally, and recommends what to teach next — all in one platform with no switching between tools.

**4. Accessible to Individual Teachers**: Panorama Solara requires a district contract. Renaissance requires institutional procurement. Gradescope requires an institutional license. Graider is available to any teacher with a browser. No IT department approval, no district contract, no procurement cycle. A teacher can sign up, configure their first assignment, and start grading in under 5 minutes.

**5. Writing Style Fingerprinting for Academic Integrity**: No other grading tool builds per-student writing style baselines and compares new submissions against them. Turnitin does plagiarism detection (comparing text against a database of sources). Graider does writing style profiling (comparing text against the student's own historical writing patterns). These are fundamentally different approaches that catch different kinds of academic dishonesty.

**6. Accommodation-Aware Everything**: IEP/504 accommodations in Graider are not just labels — they modify grading expectations, feedback language, feedback structure, and feedback tone at the AI prompt level. No other grading tool provides this level of accommodation awareness. Most competitors offer, at best, extended time on quizzes.

**7. Bilingual Feedback Generation**: No other grading tool generates dual-language feedback based on teacher-configured language settings per student. This is critical in diverse school districts where a significant percentage of students are English Language Learners and their parents may not read English-only feedback.

**8. Per-Question Granularity with Expected Answer Matching**: Most AI graders evaluate the whole assignment at once. Graider grades each question independently and matches it against the teacher's expected answer for that specific question. This produces dramatically more accurate scoring on fact-based subjects where there are objectively correct answers.

### Market Positioning

Graider occupies a unique position in the EdTech landscape: it is a comprehensive AI-powered grading and planning assistant that is accessible to individual teachers (unlike enterprise platforms), covers the full teaching workflow (unlike single-purpose tools), and maintains FERPA compliance with server-side data storage (unlike cloud-first platforms that share data with multiple vendors).

The market can be segmented as follows:

| Segment | Products | What They Do | What They Miss |
|---------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Grading Workflow | Gradescope | Batch grading with answer grouping | No analytics, no chat, no lesson planning |
| Essay Grading | CoGrader, EssayGrader, Kangaroos AI | AI grades essays with rubrics | Only essays, no analytics, no IEP/504 |
| District Analytics | Panorama Solara | Chat-based student data queries | Queries behavior/attendance, does not grade |
| Standardized Testing | Renaissance, i-Ready, NWEA MAP | Adaptive standardized assessments | Cannot grade teacher-created work |
| AI Teacher Tools | SchoolAI, Brisk | Content generation, student tutoring | No grading analytics, no diagnostic insights |
| Quiz Platforms | Kahoot, Wayground, Google Forms | Auto-grade MC/TF | Cannot grade open-ended responses |
| **Complete Assistant** | **Graider** | **All of the above, integrated** | **Nothing -- covers the full workflow** |

## FAQ

### Q1: Is Graider free?

Yes. Graider has a free tier using Google Gemini as the AI model. For GPT-4o or Claude, teachers bring their own API key. The typical cost is $0.01-0.05 per assignment graded, which works out to under $50 per year for 5,000+ assignments. There is no per-seat licensing.

### Q2: Does Graider store student data in the cloud?

Student data is stored on the Graider server (hosted on Railway). Student names, roster data, grades, feedback, and profiles are stored server-side and are accessible only to the authenticated teacher. Student work text (without names or identifiers) is sent to AI providers for grading, but nothing is stored by the AI providers. Data is never sold, shared with EdTech vendors, or aggregated across districts.

### Q3: What file types does Graider accept?

Word documents (.docx), PDFs, and photos/scans of handwritten work (JPG, PNG). The AI can read both typed and handwritten text. Handwritten work is processed using GPT-4o vision capabilities.

### Q4: Can Graider grade math and STEM assignments?

Yes. Graider includes a specialized STEM grading module with: symbolic math equivalence checking using SymPy (handles fractions, percentages, algebraic expressions, LaTeX), step-by-step solution evaluation with partial credit, tolerance-based data table grading for science labs, and distance-based coordinate grading for geography. The worksheet generator can embed LaTeX math expressions, number lines, coordinate planes, graphs, box plots, and geometric shapes.

### Q5: Does Graider work with my state's standards?

Graider includes comprehensive standards databases searchable by subject, grade level, and standard code. Each standard includes DOK level, essential questions, learning targets, key vocabulary, item specifications, and sample assessments. Deep benchmark data is currently available for Florida B.E.S.T. standards, with additional states being continuously added.

### Q6: How accurate is the AI grading?

When configured with expected answers and a clear rubric, AI grading closely aligns with teacher grading in most cases. The 3-pass pipeline with 18 contextual factors produces more accurate and consistent grades than single-prompt approaches. Multi-model ensemble mode further improves accuracy by taking the median of three independent models. Teachers always review and approve grades before export — Graider is designed as an assistant, not a replacement for teacher judgment.

### Q7: Can multiple teachers use Graider at the same school?

Yes. Each teacher has their own Supabase-authenticated account with separate settings, rosters, grading configurations, lesson plans, and student data. No data is shared between teacher accounts.

### Q8: Is student data used to train AI models?

No. OpenAI and Anthropic API terms explicitly prohibit training on API data. Google Gemini API also does not train on API-submitted data. Graider removes all personally identifiable information before sending content to AI providers. Content is processed and discarded by the AI provider; it is not retained or used for model improvement.

### Q9: What kind of feedback does Graider generate?

Graider generates personalized, constructive feedback that: quotes specific student answers, celebrates strengths, provides targeted improvement guidance, uses age-appropriate language, references student history and trajectory, adapts to IEP/504 accommodation presets (simplified language, chunked feedback, extra encouragement, etc.), and auto-translates for ELL students in both English and their primary language.

### Q10: How long does grading take?

30 assignments are typically graded in under 3 minutes. Graider uses 5 concurrent workers and a smart hybrid model (GPT-4o-mini for per-question scoring, GPT-4o for feedback narratives) to optimize both speed and quality. Grading runs in a background thread so the UI remains responsive.

### Q11: What if the internet goes down during grading?

Graider saves progress after each graded assignment. If connectivity drops, grading pauses and resumes exactly where it left off when the connection returns. No work is lost.

### Q12: Can teachers override AI grades?

Absolutely. The teacher reviews every grade and piece of feedback before it is finalized. Teachers can edit scores, modify feedback text, dismiss AI detection flags, and adjust any result. Graider is an assistant, not an autonomous grading system. The teacher is always the final authority.

### Q13: How does Graider handle handwritten work?

Teachers take a photo of the handwritten assignment (phone camera, scanner, or tablet photo). The image is uploaded to Graider, which uses GPT-4o vision capabilities to read the handwriting and extract text. The extracted text then goes through the same 3-pass grading pipeline as typed submissions. No separate OCR software or scanning setup is needed.

### Q14: Does Graider integrate with Google Classroom or Canvas?

Currently, Graider integrates with Focus SIS via browser automation and CSV export. Integration with Google Classroom, Canvas, Schoology, and other LMS platforms is planned for the Enterprise Edition (Phase 4 on the roadmap). In the meantime, teachers can export grades from Graider and import them into any LMS that accepts CSV files.

### Q15: Can the AI Teaching Assistant access curriculum documents?

Yes. Teachers can upload supporting documents (curriculum guides, pacing calendars, rubrics, textbook excerpts) to Graider. The AI Teaching Assistant can list all uploaded resources and read their full text. This allows the assistant to reference curriculum content when generating lesson plans, worksheets, and recommendations.

### Q16: Is Graider available outside the United States?

Graider is a web application accessible from any browser worldwide. However, the curriculum standards database is currently focused on U.S. state standards (with comprehensive data for Florida B.E.S.T. and expanding). Teachers outside the U.S. can use all grading, feedback, and analytics features; only the standards-aligned lesson planning feature is U.S.-specific at this time.

### Q17: How does Graider handle large class sizes?

Graider has no limit on the number of students per class or assignments per teacher. The 5-concurrent-worker architecture scales linearly: 30 assignments take approximately 3 minutes, 60 assignments take approximately 6 minutes, and so on. Teachers with 150+ students across multiple periods can grade all assignments in a single batch.

### Q18: Can I use Graider for formative assessments (not just summative)?

Yes. Graider is designed for both formative and summative assessment grading. For formative assessments, teachers typically use lenient grading mode with effort-focused feedback to encourage student participation without penalizing mistakes. The quick turnaround (3 minutes for a class set) makes it practical to grade daily formative checks, exit tickets, and bell ringers.

### Q19: Does Graider support rubric-free grading?

Yes. While rubrics produce the most detailed results, teachers can grade without a custom rubric. Graider will use a default balanced rubric (Content 40%, Completeness 25%, Quality 20%, Effort 15%) and rely on expected answers and grading notes for evaluation criteria. The teacher can also provide free-text AI instructions like "grade based on completeness and effort only."

### Q20: What happens if an AI model hallucinates or produces an inaccurate grade?

This is why Graider uses the 3-pass pipeline with teacher review, rather than autonomous grading. Safeguards include: (1) per-question grading reduces the scope of any single hallucination, (2) expected answer matching catches cases where the AI might accept an incorrect response, (3) ensemble mode with 3 models eliminates outlier scores, (4) score caps and rubric constraints prevent wildly inflated or deflated scores, and (5) the teacher reviews every grade before it is finalized. In practice, the 18-factor approach produces grades that closely align with teacher grading when expected answers and rubrics are well-configured.

### Q21: Can Graider grade group projects or collaborative assignments?

Graider currently grades individual student submissions. For group projects, the teacher can: (1) have each student submit an individual reflection or component, or (2) submit the group project once and apply the same grade to all group members manually. Collaborative assignment grading with individual contribution analysis is on the roadmap.

### Q22: Does Graider work with Google Drive or OneDrive?

Graider can monitor folders for new submissions, and those folders can be synced with OneDrive, SharePoint, or Google Drive. Students upload to the shared folder, the files sync locally, and Graider detects and grades new submissions. This allows integration with existing digital assignment collection workflows.

### Q23: How does the AI Teaching Assistant differ from ChatGPT or Claude.ai?

The AI Teaching Assistant is not a generic chatbot. It has access to structured tools that query the teacher's actual gradebook data, roster, lesson plans, curriculum standards, and teaching calendar. When the teacher asks "How is Maria doing?", the assistant queries the grades database and returns actual scores, trends, and category breakdowns. ChatGPT and Claude.ai have no access to the teacher's data and can only provide generic advice. The assistant also generates and downloads documents (worksheets, lesson plans, CSV exports) directly, which generic chatbots cannot do.

### Q24: What subjects does Graider work best with?

Graider works with any K-12 subject. It performs best with:
- **Social Studies / History**: Excellent for Cornell Notes, essay responses, vocabulary, and document-based questions.
- **ELA / English**: Strong for essay grading, literary analysis, and written responses.
- **Science**: Supports lab reports, data table grading, and vocabulary-heavy assignments.
- **Math**: SymPy-powered symbolic math grading handles algebraic equivalence, fractions, and multi-step problems.
- **Foreign Language**: Supports grading written responses in any language.
- **General**: Any assignment that involves written student responses (short answer, essay, fill-in-the-blank, vocabulary) can be graded by Graider.

## Detailed Technical Architecture

### Grading Engine Internals

The grading engine is the core of Graider. It orchestrates the entire 3-pass pipeline, manages concurrent workers, handles failover between AI providers, and ensures consistent results.

#### Multipass Orchestrator (`grade_multipass`)

The `grade_multipass` function is the entry point for grading a single student assignment. It:

1. Receives the parsed document content, assignment configuration, rubric settings, and all 18 contextual factors.
2. Calls `grade_per_question` for each extracted question, distributing work across 5 concurrent workers.
3. Aggregates per-question scores into a total score with rubric category breakdowns.
4. Applies effort and completeness adjustments (missing sections cap the maximum score).
5. Applies grading style adjustments (lenient/standard/strict score caps).
6. Calls `generate_feedback` to produce the personalized feedback narrative.
7. Returns the complete grading result: total score, per-question scores, category breakdowns, feedback text, and AI detection results.

#### Per-Question Grading (`grade_per_question`)

Each question is graded independently with its own API call. The prompt includes:

- The question prompt (what was asked)
- The student's answer (what they wrote)
- The expected answer (what the teacher expects)
- The rubric categories and weights
- The section type (vocab, short answer, fill-in-blank, summary, written)
- The grading style (lenient/standard/strict)
- The student's grade level and subject
- Any global AI instructions or assignment-specific grading notes
- The student's accommodation type (if applicable)

The AI returns a structured JSON response with:
- A numerical score for the question
- Per-category scores (content knowledge, critical thinking, writing quality, effort)
- Brief justification for the score
- Whether the answer was partially correct, fully correct, or incorrect
- Any AI detection flags

#### Feedback Generation (`generate_feedback`)

After all questions are scored, the feedback generator receives:
- All per-question scores and justifications
- The student's historical profile (trends, strengths, growth areas)
- The student's accommodation presets
- The student's ELL language (if applicable)
- The grading style

It produces a multi-paragraph feedback narrative that is personalized, constructive, and tone-appropriate. For ELL students, it generates a second version in the student's primary language.

#### Single-Pass Mode (Claude/Gemini)

For assignments graded with Claude or Gemini as the primary model, Graider can use a single-pass approach (`grade_assignment`) where the entire assignment is sent in one API call. This is faster but less granular than the multipass pipeline. The single-pass mode still applies all 18 contextual factors but evaluates them holistically rather than per-question.

### STEM Grading Module

The STEM grading module provides specialized grading logic that goes beyond text comparison.

#### Math Grading

- **Symbolic equivalence**: Uses SymPy to determine if a student's answer is mathematically equivalent to the correct answer. For example, `1/2`, `0.5`, `50%`, and `2/4` are all recognized as equivalent.
- **Input normalization**: Handles student math notation including: plain numbers, percentages (with `%` sign), fraction strings (`1/2`), implicit multiplication (`2x` becomes `2*x`), caret exponents (`x^2` becomes `x**2`), and LaTeX expressions.
- **Partial credit**: For multi-step problems, the grading system can identify correct intermediate steps even if the final answer is wrong.
- **Tolerance-based comparison**: For decimal answers, a configurable tolerance (default 0.001) allows for rounding differences.

#### Science Grading

- **Data table comparison**: For lab reports and science assignments, student data tables are compared against expected values with tolerance-based matching. A measurement of 9.8 when the expected value is 10.0 can be accepted if the tolerance allows it.
- **Unit recognition**: The system recognizes common unit formats and conversions.

#### Geography Grading

- **Coordinate distance**: Geographic coordinates are graded using the Haversine formula. A student who answers "28.5, -81.4" when the correct answer is "28.54, -81.38" receives credit based on how close their coordinates are.
- **Place name matching**: Fuzzy matching for geographic place names that accounts for spelling variations and common abbreviations.

### Visualization Engine

The visualization engine generates images for worksheets, documents, and assessments.

#### Supported Visual Types

- **Number Lines**: Configurable min/max range, labeled tick marks, plotted points. Used for rational number activities, integer comparison, and fraction placement.
- **Coordinate Planes**: 4-quadrant grid with configurable x and y ranges. Supports plotted points with labels. Used for graphing activities, function plotting, and geometric transformations.
- **Bar Charts**: Category-value charts with customizable labels, axis titles, and colors. Used for data analysis, statistics, and comparison activities.
- **Line Graphs**: X-Y data plots with connected points. Supports multiple data series. Used for trend analysis and function visualization.
- **Scatter Plots**: X-Y data points without connecting lines. Supports optional trend line. Used for correlation analysis and data interpretation.
- **Box Plots**: Statistical distribution visualization showing median, quartiles, and outliers. Supports multiple data sets for comparison.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Triangles and rectangles with labeled dimensions (base, height, width). Used for area, perimeter, and geometry problems.
- **LaTeX Math Rendering**: Converts LaTeX expressions into high-quality PNG images. Supports fractions, exponents, roots, integrals, summations, matrices, and any standard LaTeX math notation.

All visualizations can be rendered in "blank" mode where data is hidden for students to fill in, or in "completed" mode for reference materials and answer keys.

### Document Generation Engine

The document generation engine creates formatted Word documents (.docx) with professional typography.

#### Supported Content Blocks

- **Headings**: Three levels of headings with configurable fonts, sizes, and colors.
- **Paragraphs**: Body text with markdown support for **bold** and *italic* formatting.
- **Bullet Lists**: Unordered lists with customizable bullets.
- **Numbered Lists**: Ordered lists with automatic numbering.
- **Tables**: Data tables with customizable header backgrounds, text colors, and cell formatting.
- **Visual Blocks**: Any visualization type (math, graphs, shapes, number lines) can be embedded inline within documents.

#### Configurable Styles

Teachers can save and reuse document visual styles:

| Style Property | Description | Default |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| title_font_name | Font for document title | Georgia |
| title_font_size | Title font size | 24pt |
| heading_font_name | Font for section headings | Georgia |
| heading_sizes | Sizes for H1, H2, H3 | 18, 14, 12 |
| heading_color | Heading text color | #2F5496 |

## Detailed Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Social Studies Teacher Grading Cornell Notes

A 7th-grade Social Studies teacher assigns Cornell Notes on Chapter 12: The Louisiana Purchase. 30 students across 5 periods submit Word documents.

1. The teacher opens Graider and selects the "Cornell Notes Ch. 12" assignment configuration (previously set up with expected answers, vocabulary definitions, and summary key points).
2. The teacher uploads the folder of 150 student documents.
3. Graider begins grading: Pass 1 extracts each student's questions column, notes column, vocabulary responses, and summary. Pass 2 grades each section against expected answers and the Cornell Notes rubric (with categories: Note Quality 30%, Vocabulary 20%, Questions 15%, Summary 20%, Effort 15%). Pass 3 generates feedback.
4. AI detection runs in parallel. Two students are flagged: one for AI phrase detection (90% confidence), one for contrast detection (student wrote "idk" for question 3 but sophisticated prose for question 7).
5. The teacher reviews results in the dashboard. Approves 148 grades, adjusts 2 flagged students. Exports to Focus SIS.
6. Total time: 8 minutes (3 minutes grading + 5 minutes review). Without Graider: approximately 12 hours.

### Use Case 2: Math Teacher Creating and Grading a Worksheet

An 8th-grade Math teacher needs a worksheet on solving linear equations.

1. The teacher asks the AI Teaching Assistant: "Create a worksheet on solving linear equations with 10 problems, include number lines and coordinate planes for the graphing section."
2. The assistant calls `generate_worksheet` with embedded LaTeX math expressions, a number line for integer solutions, and a coordinate plane for graphing problems. The worksheet is saved as a Word document with an invisible answer key.
3. Students complete the worksheet on paper. The teacher photographs each student's work.
4. Graider processes the photos using GPT-4o vision, extracts handwritten math answers, and grades them using the STEM grading module with SymPy symbolic equivalence checking. A student who writes `2/4` when the answer is `1/2` receives full credit.
5. The teacher reviews results and exports.

### Use Case 3: ELA Teacher with IEP/504 Students

A 6th-grade ELA teacher grades persuasive essays. Three students have IEP accommodations, two are ELL students.

1. The teacher uploads essays. The roster includes accommodation presets: Student A has "Simplified Language + Extra Encouragement", Student B has "Modified Expectations", Student C has "Chunked Feedback + Growth Mindset."
2. Graider grades all essays with the same rubric. For the three IEP students, grading expectations are automatically adjusted: Student B's grammar and spelling errors are not penalized (Modified Expectations focuses on content understanding). Feedback for all three uses their specific accommodation style.
3. For the two ELL students (one Spanish-speaking, one Haitian Creole-speaking), feedback is generated in both English and their primary language.
4. The teacher reviews: all 30 essays graded consistently, with differentiated feedback that respects each student's needs.

### Use Case 4: Teacher Asking the AI Assistant for Analytics

After grading a unit test, a teacher wants to understand the results.

1. Teacher: "What caused the low grades on the Unit 5 Test?"
2. Assistant calls `analyze_grade_causes` and responds: "Content accuracy was the weakest category (avg 14.2/30). The most commonly missed questions were #7 (causes of the Civil War, 72% incorrect) and #12 (Reconstruction amendments, 68% incorrect). Students with omissions averaged 58.3; students without averaged 74.1 -- a 15.8-point gap."
3. Teacher: "What should I teach next based on these results?"
4. Assistant calls `recommend_next_lesson` and responds: "For your standard periods, I recommend a review lesson on causes of the Civil War focusing on DOK 1-2 standards SS.8.A.5.1 through SS.8.A.5.4. For your honors period, push to DOK 3 with a primary source analysis of Lincoln's speeches. For your support period, start with vocabulary re-teaching of key terms: secession, abolition, states' rights."
5. Teacher: "Compare Period 3 and Period 5 on this test."
6. Assistant calls `compare_periods` and responds: "Period 3 (Honors) averaged 81.2 with 45% As. Period 5 (Support) averaged 62.7 with 60% Ds and Fs. The biggest gap was in Critical Thinking (Period 3: 18.4/25, Period 5: 10.1/25)."

### Use Case 5: Automating Focus SIS Grade Upload

A teacher has graded assignments and wants to upload to Focus gradebook.

1. Teacher: "Create a Focus assignment called Unit 5 Test worth 100 points for February 14, category Assessments."
2. The assistant calls `create_focus_assignment`. Playwright opens a browser, navigates to VPortal, logs in (teacher completes 2FA on their phone), navigates to Focus gradebook, creates the assignment with the specified details.
3. Teacher: "Export the grades for Unit 5 Test as a Focus CSV."
4. The assistant calls `export_grades_csv`. Per-period CSV files are generated with Student ID and Score columns, ready for Focus import.

### Use Case 6: Lesson Planning from Standards

A teacher needs to plan next week's lessons.

1. Teacher: "What standards should I cover next? I just finished SS.7.C.1.1."
2. Assistant calls `list_all_standards` and `get_recent_lessons` to see what has been taught. Responds: "Based on your pacing, the next standard is SS.7.C.1.2: Trace the impact that the Declaration of Independence has had on political life. This is a DOK 2 standard with vocabulary: natural rights, consent of the governed, popular sovereignty."
3. Teacher: "Brainstorm 5 lesson ideas for that standard."
4. Assistant generates 5 creative concepts: Declaration of Independence Escape Room, Founders' Debate (Socratic seminar), Design Your Bill of Rights (project), Declaration Remix (modernize the language), and Primary Source Detective (analyze original text).
5. Teacher: "I like the Founders' Debate. Generate a full 3-day lesson plan."
6. Assistant generates a detailed plan with day-by-day breakdowns, bell ringers, activities, exit tickets, vocabulary, and materials. The teacher schedules it on the calendar for next week.

- **Questions**: An array of question objects, each with:
  - `id`: Unique question identifier
  - `type`: Question type (`short_answer`, `vocab_term`, `written`, `fill_in_blank`)
  - `prompt`: The question text
  - `points`: Point value for this question
  - `marker`: Section marker text (used to locate the question in student documents)
  - `expected_answer`: The correct or expected answer
- **Total Points**: Total point value for the assignment (default 100).
- **Effort Points**: Points allocated for effort and completeness (default 15).
- **Grading Notes**: Free-text grading notes with expected answers, vocabulary definitions, and key points.
- **Rubric Type**: The rubric type override for this assignment (`standard`, `cornell-notes`, `fill-in-blank`).
- **Custom Markers**: Section markers that define where gradeable sections begin in the document.

### Rubric Types

| Rubric Type | Categories | Use Case |
|-------------|-----------|----------|
| Standard | Content Knowledge, Critical Thinking, Writing Quality, Effort | Essays, short answer, general assignments |
| Cornell Notes | Note Quality, Vocabulary, Questions, Summary, Effort | Cornell Notes formatted assignments |

## How Graider Compares: Real-World Scenarios

To illustrate the practical differences between Graider and competitors, consider how each handles common teacher tasks.

### Scenario: Grading 30 Cornell Notes Submissions

**With Kahoot/Google Forms**: Not possible. These platforms cannot grade open-ended written responses. The teacher grades all 30 by hand (approximately 3-5 hours).

**With CoGrader**: Partially possible. CoGrader can grade long essays but is not designed for multi-section assignments like Cornell Notes with vocabulary, questions, notes, and summary sections. The teacher would need to split each section into separate essay submissions, losing the assignment context.

**With Gradescope**: Possible but labor-intensive. Gradescope groups similar answers for bulk rubric application. The teacher still reviews each group and applies rubrics manually. No per-question expected answer matching. No feedback generation. Time: approximately 1-2 hours.

**With Graider**: Upload folder, click grade, review results. Graider extracts each section (vocabulary, questions, notes, summary), grades each question against expected answers with 18 contextual factors, generates personalized feedback, and runs AI detection in parallel. Time: approximately 8 minutes (3 minutes grading + 5 minutes review).

### Scenario: Understanding Why a Class Performed Poorly

**With Kahoot/Google Forms**: Shows "Class average: 62%." No explanation of why.

**With CoGrader**: Shows individual student grades with feedback. No class-wide analysis. The teacher reads 30 feedback comments manually to find patterns.

**With Panorama Solara**: Can query behavior and attendance data, but cannot analyze assignment grades. Cannot answer "Which rubric category was weakest?" because it does not grade assignments.

**With Renaissance Star**: Shows which standards are mastered vs. not based on standardized test items. Cannot analyze the teacher's specific assignment.

**With Graider**: Teacher asks the AI assistant: "What caused the low grades?" The assistant responds: "Content accuracy was the weakest category (avg 14.2/30). Question 7 (causes of the Civil War) was missed by 72% of students. 61% left at least one section blank, costing an average of 13.3 points. Students with omissions averaged 66.6; without averaged 79.9."

### Scenario: Planning a Differentiated Follow-Up Lesson

**With any competitor**: Not available. No competitor analyzes grading data and recommends differentiated lessons.

**With Graider**: Teacher asks: "What should I teach next based on these results?" The assistant analyzes weaknesses, cross-references curriculum standards, and recommends: "For honors (DOK 3-4): Primary source analysis of Lincoln's speeches with thesis development. For standard (DOK 1-3): Guided practice on identifying causes of conflict with graphic organizers. For support (DOK 1-2): Vocabulary re-teaching of key terms with visual aids."

### Scenario: Communicating with Parents of Struggling Students

**With any competitor**: Not available. The teacher manually writes and sends parent emails.

**With Graider**: Teacher asks: "Email parents of students below 60 on the last assignment." The assistant identifies the students, looks up parent contact information, drafts a personalized email template with {student_first_name} placeholders, shows a dry-run preview, and sends after teacher approval. Each parent receives a personalized email referencing their specific child's grade and areas for improvement.

### Scenario: Grading a Student with an IEP

**With Kahoot/Google Forms**: No accommodation support. Same quiz, same scoring for everyone.

**With CoGrader**: No IEP/504 support. Same rubric applied to all students.

**With Gradescope**: No accommodation awareness. Teacher manually adjusts after grading.

**With Graider**: The student's accommodation presets (e.g., "Modified Expectations" + "Simplified Language") are automatically applied. Grading focuses on content understanding rather than writing mechanics. Feedback uses shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary. No manual adjustment needed.

### Scenario: Detecting AI-Generated Student Work

**With Turnitin**: Plagiarism detection against a database of sources. Limited AI detection based on text patterns in isolation. No student-specific baseline comparison.

**With any other competitor**: No AI detection capability.

**With Graider**: 4-layer detection system compares the submission against: (1) known AI phrases for the grade level, (2) the student's own historical writing fingerprint, (3) contrast between easy and hard responses within the same assignment, and (4) deviations from the student's statistical baseline. Detection improves with every assignment graded as the student profile becomes more accurate.

---

## Key Design Principles

### Teacher-in-the-Loop

Graider is explicitly designed as an AI assistant, not an autonomous grading system. The teacher is always the final authority. Every grade, every piece of feedback, and every AI detection flag is presented for teacher review before finalization. This is both an educational philosophy (teachers know their students best) and a practical safeguard against AI hallucination.

### Privacy by Architecture

Student privacy is not enforced by policy alone but by architecture. The system is designed so that PII physically cannot reach AI providers. Student names are stripped before API calls are constructed. The code path from student document to AI prompt passes through a PII removal step that is not optional and cannot be bypassed.

### Cost Transparency

Teachers see exactly what AI processing costs. The BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model means there are no hidden per-seat fees, no surprise invoices, and no vendor lock-in. If a teacher wants to switch AI providers or stop using Graider, their data is exportable and their API keys are their own.

### Incremental Adoption

Graider is designed for incremental adoption. A teacher can start by grading one assignment with Graider while continuing to grade everything else by hand. There is no all-or-nothing commitment. The system proves its value one assignment at a time.
