# The Problem

## Teachers Are Drowning in Grading

- **Average teacher**: 5+ hours per week grading assignments
- **300+ assignments** to grade per week (30 students × 5 classes × 2 assignments)
- **Delayed feedback** means students miss learning opportunities
- **Inconsistent grading** when teachers are fatigued
- **Burnout** is a leading cause of teacher attrition

> *"I became a teacher to help students, not to spend my evenings buried in papers."*

### The Secret Sauce

```
Your Rubric + Assignment Config + Student Work
                    ↓
         GPT-4o Analysis Engine
                    ↓

---

# Key Features

## Student Progress Tracking

### Personalized Learning Insights

After 3+ assignments, Graider tracks each student's:

- **Performance trends** - Improving, stable, or declining
- **Skill patterns** - Reading comprehension, critical thinking, etc.
- **Baseline profile** - What's "normal" for this student

### AI Uses History for Better Feedback:

| **Dual Feedback** | English feedback + native language translation |
| **ELL Support** | Helps students understand while learning English |
| **Editable** | Teachers can modify both versions |
| **Parent Communication** | Families can read feedback in their language |

### Sample Bilingual Feedback:
> *Great work on your vocabulary matching! Your answers show you understood the key concepts...*
>
> *---*
>
> *¡Excelente trabajo en tu emparejamiento de vocabulario! Tus respuestas muestran que entendiste los conceptos clave...*

### Why This Matters
- **30%+ of Florida students** are English Language Learners
- Parents often can't help with English-only feedback
- Students learn better when they understand their feedback
- Builds bridge between classroom and home

4. Students receive personalized feedback matching their needs
```

### Sample Accommodated Feedback (Simplified Language + Extra Encouragement):
> *You did a great job! Here are 3 things you did well:*
> *1. You answered the main question correctly.*

# Roadmap: School & District Analytics

## Data-Driven Insights at Every Level

### Coming Soon: Multi-Level Analytics Dashboard

Graider is building analytics capabilities that aggregate data while maintaining privacy:

```

│   Compare schools • Track trends • Identify support needs        │
│                              ↑                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                       SCHOOL LEVEL                               │
│   Teacher performance • Subject insights • Student outcomes      │
│                              ↑                                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

# Roadmap: Admin Panel

## Centralized Management for Schools & Districts

### Role-Based Administration

```
Super Admin (Graider)
    └── District Admin
            └── School Admin / Principal
                    └── Teacher
```

### Admin Panel Features

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **District Admin** | Add/manage schools, assign principals, view all district analytics, export reports, manage teacher accounts |
| **School Admin** | Add/manage teachers, view school analytics, configure school settings, sync oversight |
| **Principal** | View teacher performance, school-wide trends, generate reports for stakeholders |

### Dashboard Views

| View | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| **District Overview** | All schools at a glance, comparison rankings, alerts for underperformance |
| **School Drilldown** | Teacher activity, subject breakdown, grade distributions, sync status |
| **Teacher Detail** | Individual grading history, student outcomes, feedback quality metrics |
| **Trend Analysis** | Month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter performance tracking |

### Management Tools

- **User Management**: Add teachers via CSV import or SSO integration (Clever, ClassLink)
- **School Configuration**: Set grading scales, rubric defaults, subject mappings
- **Data Governance**: Control sync frequency, anonymization settings, retention policies
- **Audit Logs**: Track who accessed what data and when (FERPA compliance)
- **Report Generation**: Export PDF/Excel reports for board meetings, accreditation

### Privacy-First Design

| Feature | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Student Anonymization** | Only hashed IDs at aggregate levels - no PII leaves teacher's device |
| **Opt-In Sync** | Teachers control when and what data syncs up |
| **Role-Based Access** | Teachers see own data, principals see school, admins see district |
| **Local-First Option** | Schools can run entirely local with no cloud dependency |

### Why This Matters

- **Principals**: "Which subjects need more support this quarter?"
- **Curriculum Directors**: "How are our new standards being assessed?"
- **Superintendents**: "How do schools compare on writing skills?"
- **IT Admins**: "Is the platform being adopted? Who needs training?"

### Implementation Approach

- **Phase 1**: Local school analytics (current teacher data + opt-in sharing)
- **Phase 2**: District aggregation with secure cloud backend
- **Phase 3**: Admin panel with user management and reporting
- **Phase 4**: Real-time dashboards with live updates
- **Phase 5**: SSO integration and benchmark comparisons

> *"Give administrators the insights and control they need without compromising the privacy teachers and students deserve."*
