# The Problem

## Teachers Are Drowning in Grading

- **Average teacher**: 5+ hours per week grading assignments
- **300+ assignments** to grade per week (30 students × 5 classes × 2 assignments)
- **Delayed feedback** means students miss learning opportunities
- **Inconsistent grading** when teachers are fatigued
- **Burnout** is a leading cause of teacher attrition

> *"I became a teacher to help students, not to spend my evenings buried in papers."*

---

# The Solution

## Graider: Your AI Teaching Assistant

**Grade 100 assignments in minutes, not hours.**

Graider uses advanced AI to:
- Read and analyze student work (typed or handwritten)
- Apply your rubric consistently
- Generate personalized, encouraging feedback

# Key Features

## Intelligent Grading

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Multi-Format Support** | Word docs, PDFs, and handwritten work (photos) |
| **Customizable Rubrics** | Your criteria, your point values |
| **Assignment Configs** | Save setups for reuse across periods/years |
| **Batch Processing** | Grade entire class with one click |

---

# Key Features

## Personalized Feedback

### AI-Generated, Teacher-Quality Comments

- Quotes specific student answers
- Celebrates strengths with genuine enthusiasm
- Provides constructive guidance on improvements
- Uses age-appropriate language
- **Never uses student names in AI processing** (FERPA compliant)

### Sample Feedback:
> *"Your answer about the Louisiana Purchase - 'It doubled the size of America for only 15 million dollars' - shows you really understood the significance! For the question about Jefferson's dilemma, think about what the Constitution says about buying land..."*

---

# Key Features

## Student Progress Tracking

### Personalized Learning Insights

After 3+ assignments, Graider tracks each student's:

- **Performance trends** - Improving, stable, or declining
- **Skill patterns** - Reading comprehension, critical thinking, etc.
- **Baseline profile** - What's "normal" for this student

### AI Uses History for Better Feedback:
> *"You're on a 3-assignment improvement streak in writing quality!"*
> *"Your reading comprehension continues to be a real strength!"*

---

# Key Features

## Academic Integrity Detection

### Multi-Layer Protection System

**Layer 1: AI Phrase Detection**
- Flags vocabulary too sophisticated for grade level
- Detects specific AI-generated phrases ("transformed the nation", "fueling expansion")
- Catches academic language no child would use
- Confidence score (0-100%)

**Layer 2: Writing Style Profiling**
Each student builds a unique writing fingerprint over time:

| Metric Tracked | What It Catches |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Complexity Score** | Sudden jump from 3/10 to 10/10 = AI |
| **Sentence Length** | Student who writes 5-word sentences suddenly writes 20-word sentences |
| **Academic Vocabulary** | Zero academic words → 5 academic words = flagged |
| **Word Length** | Average 4-letter words → 7-letter words = suspicious |
| **Spelling Patterns** | Student who misspells "Thomas" doesn't write "constitutional authority" |

**Layer 3: Contrast Detection**
Compares simple answers to written responses within the same assignment:
- Student writes "idk" for one question
- Then writes "transforming a limited mission into a historic deal" for another
- **Automatic flag for AI use**

**Layer 4: Historical Comparison**
- Compares submission to student's historical writing profile
- Flags significant deviations from established patterns
- Gets smarter with each assignment graded

### Penalty System
| Detection Level | Maximum Score |
|-----------------|---------------|
| AI "likely" | 50 (F) |
| AI "possible" | 65 (D) |
| Plagiarism "likely" | 50 (F) |
| Both flagged | 40 (F) |

### Real Example Caught:
> Student's typical writing: *"It doubled the land. Tomas Jefferson. idk"*
>
> Same student's suspicious answer: *"Transforming a limited mission to buy New Orleans into a historic deal that doubled the size of the United States."*
>
> **Result:** Flagged as "likely AI" (90% confidence), Score: 50 (F)

# ELL & Multilingual Support

## Bilingual Feedback for Every Student

### Automatic Language Detection
Graider detects when students write responses in languages other than English and automatically provides **bilingual feedback**:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Auto-Detection** | Identifies Spanish, Creole, Portuguese, and other languages |
| **Dual Feedback** | English feedback + native language translation |
| **ELL Support** | Helps students understand while learning English |
| **Editable** | Teachers can modify both versions |
| **Parent Communication** | Families can read feedback in their language |

### Sample Bilingual Feedback:
> *Great work on your vocabulary matching! Your answers show you understood the key concepts...*
>
> *---*
>
> *¡Excelente trabajo en tu emparejamiento de vocabulario! Tus respuestas muestran que entendiste los conceptos clave...*

### Why This Matters
- **30%+ of Florida students** are English Language Learners
- Parents often can't help with English-only feedback
- Students learn better when they understand their feedback
- Builds bridge between classroom and home

# What Makes Graider Different

## Not Just Another Quiz Platform

**Wayground, Kahoot, Google Forms** — they all do the same thing: multiple choice quizzes with auto-scores.

**Graider is fundamentally different.**

---

## The Graider Difference

### 1. AI Feedback, Not Just Scores

| Platform | What Students Get |
|----------|-------------------|
| Wayground/Kahoot | "7/10 - 70%" |
| Google Forms | "Correct" / "Incorrect" |
| **Graider** | "Your analysis of the Louisiana Purchase showed strong understanding of economic impact. For your answer about Jefferson's dilemma, consider how strict Constitutional interpretation conflicted with the opportunity..." |

**Graider gives personalized, constructive feedback on every response** — the kind a great teacher writes, but in seconds instead of hours.

---

### 2. Grades Everything, Not Just Quizzes

| Assignment Type | Wayground | Kahoot | Google Forms | **Graider** |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Multiple Choice | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Short Answer | ❌ | ❌ | Manual | ✅ AI-graded |
| Essays | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ AI-graded |
| Math Problems | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ AI-graded |
| Handwritten Work | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Photo → AI |
| Lab Reports | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ AI-graded |
| Projects | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Rubric-based |

**Graider handles the messy, real-world assignments** that other platforms can't touch.

---

### 3. Works With Your Existing Workflow

Other platforms force you into their ecosystem:

```
❌ Wayground: Students must log in, take quiz in browser, data lives in their cloud
❌ Kahoot: Live game format only, no async, limited question types
❌ Google Forms: Manual grading for anything beyond MC, no real feedback
```

**Graider adapts to YOU:**

```
✅ Students submit however works for your class:
   • Upload to folder (OneDrive, Google Drive, local)
   • Turn in paper copies (scan/photo)
   • Submit through Canvas/Schoology
   • Take digital assessment (coming soon)

✅ Graider grades it all the same way
```

---

### 4. Accommodation-Aware (IEP/504 Built-In)

| Platform | Accommodation Support |
|----------|----------------------|
| Wayground | Extended time only |
| Kahoot | None |
| Google Forms | Manual |
| **Graider** | **Automatic feedback adjustment** — simplified language, extra encouragement, chunked responses, growth mindset framing |

**Same assignment, personalized feedback** for every learner's needs.

---

### 5. Bilingual Feedback (ELL Support)

| Platform | Language Support |
|----------|------------------|
| Wayground | English only |
| Kahoot | English only |
| Google Forms | English only |
| **Graider** | **Automatic Spanish translation** of all feedback, with more languages coming |

**30%+ of Florida students are ELLs.** Their parents can finally read their feedback.

---

# Teacher Testimonial

## Real Impact

> *"Graider has transformed my teaching. I used to spend every evening grading - now I spend that time planning better lessons and actually talking to my students about their work. The feedback is better than what I wrote when I was tired at 10pm, and students are getting it back the next day instead of next week."*

# Q&A

## Common Questions

**Q: What about subjects other than Social Studies?**
A: Graider works with any subject. Rubrics and AI instructions are fully customizable.

**Q: Can teachers override AI grades?**
A: Absolutely. Teachers review and can edit everything before finalizing.

**Q: What if the internet goes down during grading?**
A: Graider auto-saves progress and resumes where it left off.

**Q: How does it handle different assignment types?**
A: Supports essays, short answer, fill-in-the-blank, matching, and even handwritten work.

**Q: Is student data used to train AI?**
A: No. OpenAI's API terms prohibit training on API data, and we remove all PII anyway.
