# The Problem

## Teachers Are Drowning in Grading

- **Average teacher**: 5+ hours per week grading assignments
- **300+ assignments** to grade per week (30 students × 5 classes × 2 assignments)
- **Delayed feedback** means students miss learning opportunities
- **Inconsistent grading** when teachers are fatigued
- **Burnout** is a leading cause of teacher attrition

> *"I became a teacher to help students, not to spend my evenings buried in papers."*

---

# How the AI Actually Works

Graider is the only AI grader that grades each question individually, cross-references expected answers, adapts to IEP/504 accommodations, and validates across multiple AI models.

## The 3-Pass Grading Pipeline

Every assignment goes through three precision passes — not one bulk AI call like competitors.

```
PASS 1: EXTRACT          PASS 2: GRADE           PASS 3: FEEDBACK
─────────────────        ─────────────────       ─────────────────
Isolate each student     Grade each question     Generate personalized,
response, strip          individually against    tone-adaptive feedback.
assignment prompts,      expected answers,       Translate automatically
detect blank sections,   your rubric, and 18     for ELL students.
categorize response      contextual factors —
types.                   with 5 concurrent
                         workers for speed.

            AI detection runs in parallel — zero added wait time.
```

## 18 Factors in Every Grade

Most AI graders send one prompt: "grade this." Graider evaluates **18 contextual factors** for every single question:

| Factor | What It Does |
|--------|-------------|
| **Your Custom Rubric** | Categories, weights, and descriptions you define |
| **Expected Answers** | Matched by question number, term, or keyword |
| **Grading Style** | Lenient, standard, or strict — with automatic score caps |
| **IEP/504 Accommodations** | Modified expectations per student |
| **Student History** | Past scores, streaks, improvement trends |
| **Class Period Differentiation** | Honors vs. regular expectations |
| **Grade Level & Subject** | Age-appropriate rigor |
| **Section Type Detection** | Vocab, numbered Q, fill-in-blank, summary, written |
| **Assignment Template** | Strips prompt text so only student work is graded |
| **ELL Language** | Auto-translates feedback for English Language Learners |
| **Effort & Completeness** | Missing sections cap the maximum possible score |
| **Writing Style Profile** | Historical patterns for AI-detection comparison |
| ...and 6 more | Global AI notes, rubric type overrides, section points, FITB exemption, grading notes, section names |

**Competitors use 3 factors. Graider uses 18.**

## Multi-Model Validation

Graider doesn't depend on a single AI. Three independent models grade your assignments:

```
        ┌──────────┐
        │ OpenAI   │ ──→ Score A
        │ (GPT-4o) │
        └──────────┘
                          ┌─────────────┐
        ┌──────────┐      │ ENSEMBLE    │
        │Anthropic │ ──→ Score B ──→ │ Median score│ ──→ Final Grade
        │ (Claude) │      │ + Consensus │
        └──────────┘      └─────────────┘
        ┌──────────┐
        │ Google   │ ──→ Score C
        │ (Gemini) │
        └──────────┘
```

- **Ensemble mode** — median of 3 models eliminates outlier scores
- **Automatic failover** — if one model is down, grading continues
- **Teacher choice** — use one model or all three

## Built-In Capabilities

| Capability | Detail |
|------------|--------|

---

# Key Features

## Student Progress Tracking

### Personalized Learning Insights

After 3+ assignments, Graider tracks each student's:

- **Performance trends** - Improving, stable, or declining
- **Skill patterns** - Reading comprehension, critical thinking, etc.
- **Baseline profile** - What's "normal" for this student

### AI Uses History for Better Feedback:
> *"You're on a 3-assignment improvement streak in writing quality!"*
> *"Your reading comprehension continues to be a real strength!"*

---

# Key Features

## Academic Integrity Detection

### Multi-Layer Protection System

**Layer 1: AI Phrase Detection**
- Flags vocabulary too sophisticated for grade level
- Detects specific AI-generated phrases ("transformed the nation", "fueling expansion")
- Catches academic language no child would use
- Confidence score (0-100%)

**Layer 2: Writing Style Profiling**
Each student builds a unique writing fingerprint over time:

| Metric Tracked | What It Catches |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Complexity Score** | Sudden jump from 3/10 to 10/10 = AI |
| **Sentence Length** | Student who writes 5-word sentences suddenly writes 20-word sentences |
| **Academic Vocabulary** | Zero academic words → 5 academic words = flagged |
| **Word Length** | Average 4-letter words → 7-letter words = suspicious |
| **Spelling Patterns** | Student who misspells "Thomas" doesn't write "constitutional authority" |

**Layer 3: Contrast Detection**
Compares simple answers to written responses within the same assignment:
- Student writes "idk" for one question
- Then writes "transforming a limited mission into a historic deal" for another
- **Automatic flag for AI use**

**Layer 4: Historical Comparison**
- Compares submission to student's historical writing profile
- Flags significant deviations from established patterns
- Gets smarter with each assignment graded

### Penalty System
| Detection Level | Maximum Score |
|-----------------|---------------|
| AI "likely" | 50 (F) |
| AI "possible" | 65 (D) |
| Plagiarism "likely" | 50 (F) |
| Both flagged | 40 (F) |

### Real Example Caught:
> Student's typical writing: *"It doubled the land. Tomas Jefferson. idk"*
>
> Same student's suspicious answer: *"Transforming a limited mission to buy New Orleans into a historic deal that doubled the size of the United States."*
>
> **Result:** Flagged as "likely AI" (90% confidence), Score: 50 (F)

# ELL & Multilingual Support

## Bilingual Feedback for Every Student

### Automatic Language Detection
Graider detects when students write responses in languages other than English and automatically provides **bilingual feedback**:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **Auto-Detection** | Identifies Spanish, Creole, Portuguese, and other languages |
| **Dual Feedback** | English feedback + native language translation |
| **ELL Support** | Helps students understand while learning English |
| **Editable** | Teachers can modify both versions |
| **Parent Communication** | Families can read feedback in their language |

### Sample Bilingual Feedback:
> *Great work on your vocabulary matching! Your answers show you understood the key concepts...*
>
> *---*
>
> *¡Excelente trabajo en tu emparejamiento de vocabulario! Tus respuestas muestran que entendiste los conceptos clave...*

### Why This Matters
- **30%+ of Florida students** are English Language Learners
- Parents often can't help with English-only feedback
- Students learn better when they understand their feedback
- Builds bridge between classroom and home

### Data-Driven Lesson Recommendations

The assistant can analyze student performance and recommend exactly what to teach next:

```
Teacher: "Based on the Slavery and Resistance assignment, what should my next lesson focus on?"
```

The assistant:
1. Analyzes rubric breakdowns → writing_quality was weakest (avg 12.7)
2. Identifies content gaps → Summary section skipped by 15% of students
3. Checks developing skills → "Writing complete sentences" needed by most
4. Cross-references FL US History standards → Suggests relevant standards
5. Notes period differentiation → Advanced vs support-level recommendations
6. Returns actionable lesson focus with specific topics and standards

### Sample Questions Teachers Can Ask

| Question | What the Assistant Does |
|----------|------------------------|
| "What caused the low grades on Cornell Notes?" | Analyzes rubric category breakdowns, unanswered questions, and score impact of omissions |
| "How much did incomplete sections affect scores?" | Compares students with vs without omissions (e.g., 79.9 avg vs 66.6 avg = 13.3 point gap) |
| "Which period did best on this assignment?" | Period-by-period comparison with averages, grade distributions, and category scores |
| "What were the common feedback themes?" | Aggregates strengths and growth areas across all students with frequency counts |
| "What should I teach next?" | Data-driven lesson recommendations based on weaknesses + curriculum standards |
| "How is Maria doing?" | Full student profile: all grades, trend, category averages, strengths/weaknesses |
| "Show students below 60 on the last assignment" | Filtered grade list with feedback previews |
| "What are students' biggest strengths?" | Skill analysis showing most frequently demonstrated strengths |
| "Compare my classes on Cornell Notes" | Side-by-side period comparison with omission rates and category scores |
| "Create a Focus assignment called Quiz 3 worth 100 pts" | Launches browser automation to create the assignment in Focus SIS |

### Focus SIS Automation

Create assignments directly in Focus gradebook through the assistant:

```
Teacher: "Create a Focus assignment called Quiz 3 worth 100 points for February 14"
Assistant: I'll create that assignment in Focus. Browser opening — check your phone for 2FA...
```

- Automates VPortal login and Focus navigation via Playwright
- Teacher approves 2FA and reviews form before saving
- Credentials stored securely on the server (never shared externally)

### Privacy-First Design

| Concern | How It's Handled |
|---------|-----------------|
| Student data | Stored on **Graider's server** — never shared with third-party vendors |
| API calls | Anthropic API does NOT train on API data |
| Conversations | In-memory only, auto-cleared after 2 hours |
| Authentication | Supabase auth — only verified teachers access their data |
| Audit trail | Every assistant interaction logged to FERPA audit log |

### Streaming Responses

# Security Architecture

## For IT Administrators

### Security Data Flow Diagram

**Layer 1: Teacher's Browser**
- Teacher logs in via Supabase authentication
- Uploads student files over HTTPS

**Layer 2: Graider Server (Railway)** — all processing happens here
- Step 1: Student Files received
- Step 2: PII Removal — student names, IDs, emails, phone numbers stripped
- Step 3: Sanitized Content — only assignment text sent to AI
- Step 4: Grading Engine — AI grades against teacher's rubric
- Step 5: Results stored server-side — grades, feedback, analytics

**Layer 3: AI APIs (External)** — receive sanitized content only
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o) — grading and lesson planning
- Anthropic API (Claude) — AI assistant chat and analytics
- No PII is ever sent to these APIs
- Neither API uses submitted data for model training

**What stays where:**

| Data | Where It Lives | Who Can Access |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Student names, IDs, emails | Graider server only | Authenticated teacher only |
| Assignment content (sanitized) | Temporarily sent to AI API | Graider + AI API (not stored) |
| Grades, feedback, analytics | Graider server only | Authenticated teacher only |
| Teacher credentials | Supabase (auth only) | Teacher only |
| VPortal credentials | Graider server (encoded) | Teacher only |

**Data never goes to:** third-party analytics vendors, EdTech data aggregators, advertising platforms, other districts, or any external service beyond the AI APIs listed above.

# What Makes Graider Different

## Not Just Another Quiz Platform

**Wayground, Kahoot, Google Forms** — they all do the same thing: multiple choice quizzes with auto-scores.

**Graider is fundamentally different.**

---

## The Graider Difference

### 1. AI Feedback, Not Just Scores

| Platform | What Students Get |
|----------|-------------------|
| Wayground/Kahoot | "7/10 - 70%" |
| Google Forms | "Correct" / "Incorrect" |
| **Graider** | "Your analysis of the Louisiana Purchase showed strong understanding of economic impact. For your answer about Jefferson's dilemma, consider how strict Constitutional interpretation conflicted with the opportunity..." |

**Graider gives personalized, constructive feedback on every response** — the kind a great teacher writes, but in seconds instead of hours.

---

### 2. Grades Everything, Not Just Quizzes

| Assignment Type | Wayground | Kahoot | Google Forms | **Graider** |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Multiple Choice | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Short Answer | ❌ | ❌ | Manual | ✅ AI-graded |
| Essays | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ AI-graded |
| Math Problems | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ AI-graded |
| Handwritten Work | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Photo → AI |
| Lab Reports | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ AI-graded |
| Projects | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Rubric-based |

**Graider handles the messy, real-world assignments** that other platforms can't touch.

---

### 3. Works With Your Existing Workflow

Other platforms force you into their ecosystem:

```
❌ Wayground: Students must log in, take quiz in browser, data lives in their cloud
❌ Kahoot: Live game format only, no async, limited question types
❌ Google Forms: Manual grading for anything beyond MC, no real feedback
```

**Graider adapts to YOU:**

```
✅ Students submit however works for your class:
   • Upload to folder (OneDrive, Google Drive, local)
   • Turn in paper copies (scan/photo)
   • Submit through Canvas/Schoology
   • Take digital assessment (coming soon)

✅ Graider grades it all the same way
```

---

### 4. Accommodation-Aware (IEP/504 Built-In)

| Platform | Accommodation Support |
|----------|----------------------|
| Wayground | Extended time only |
| Kahoot | None |
| Google Forms | Manual |
| **Graider** | **Automatic feedback adjustment** — simplified language, extra encouragement, chunked responses, growth mindset framing |

**Same assignment, personalized feedback** for every learner's needs.

---

### 5. Bilingual Feedback (ELL Support)

| Platform | Language Support |
|----------|------------------|
| Wayground | English only |
| Kahoot | English only |
| Google Forms | English only |
| **Graider** | **Automatic Spanish translation** of all feedback, with more languages coming |

**30%+ of Florida students are ELLs.** Their parents can finally read their feedback.

---

### 6. Complete Teaching Loop

Other platforms are isolated tools. Graider is an **integrated teaching assistant:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**No other platform connects lesson planning → assessment → grading → analytics.**

---

### 7. Privacy-First Architecture

| Platform | Where Data Lives | Who Has Access |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Wayground | Their cloud servers | Wayground + partners |
| Kahoot | Their cloud servers | Kahoot + analytics vendors |
| Google Forms | Google's cloud | Google ecosystem |
| **Graider** | **Graider's server** — no third-party data sharing | Only the authenticated teacher |

**Student data is never sold, aggregated across districts, or shared with EdTech vendors.**

---

## The Bottom Line

> **Wayground/Kahoot/Forms = Quiz tools with scores**
>
> **Graider = AI teaching assistant that handles everything**

| Capability | Quiz Platforms | Graider |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| Auto-grade MC/TF | ✅ | ✅ |
| Grade written responses | ❌ | ✅ |
| Personalized feedback | ❌ | ✅ |
| Handwriting recognition | ❌ | ✅ |
| IEP/504 accommodations | ❌ | ✅ |

### Competitor Deep Dive

#### Gradescope (by Turnitin)
- **What it does:** AI-assisted grading workflow — groups similar answers, applies rubrics across groups, handles STEM (code autograders, bubble sheets, handwriting recognition for math)
- **Conversational AI:** None. Dashboard-only analytics
- **Cause analysis:** No. Shows score distributions but not why students scored low
- **Lesson recommendations:** None
- **IEP/504:** No accommodation support
- **Pricing:** Institutional license ($3-5/student/year estimated)
- **Gap:** Workflow tool for grading efficiency, not diagnostic analytics. No AI chat, no feedback aggregation, no lesson planning

#### CoGrader
- **What it does:** AI essay grading against rubrics with feedback generation. Tight Google Classroom integration
- **Conversational AI:** None. Shows individual grades with feedback
- **Cause analysis:** No. Per-student feedback only, no class-wide pattern analysis
- **Lesson recommendations:** None
- **IEP/504:** No accommodation support
- **Pricing:** Per-teacher subscription (~$10-15/month)
- **Gap:** Grades essays but stops there. No analytics dashboard, no conversational querying, no cross-assignment trend analysis

#### Panorama Solara (Closest Competitor)
- **What it does:** FERPA-compliant AI chat tool for K-12 districts. Teachers can ask questions about student data in natural language
- **Conversational AI:** **Yes** — this is the closest competitor to Graider's assistant
- **Cause analysis:** No. Queries attendance, behavior, SEL survey data, and intervention tracking — not rubric-level grade analysis
- **Lesson recommendations:** No. Focused on MTSS interventions, not curriculum-aligned lesson planning
- **IEP/504:** Partial — tracks interventions through MTSS, but not rubric-aware accommodation analysis
- **Pricing:** Enterprise only, district-level contracts (estimated $10k+/year), not available to individual teachers
- **Gap:** Solara is an MTSS/SEL platform with a chat interface. It does NOT grade assignments, does NOT analyze rubric breakdowns, does NOT detect unanswered questions, and does NOT recommend lessons based on assessment data. It queries different data (behavior, attendance, surveys) than Graider (rubric scores, feedback, skills, omissions)

#### Renaissance Star / i-Ready (NWEA MAP)
- **What they do:** Standardized adaptive assessments. Students take computer-based tests, platform generates reports on standards mastery
- **Conversational AI:** None. Pre-built dashboard reports
- **Cause analysis:** Partial — shows which standards are mastered vs. not, but uses their own test items, not teacher-created assignments
- **Lesson recommendations:** Generic "learning paths" tied to their assessment items, not teacher-specific assignment data
- **IEP/504:** Partial — can flag students for intervention based on test scores
- **Pricing:** District-level contracts ($5-15/student/year)
- **Gap:** Tests what students know on standardized items. Cannot grade teacher-created assignments, does not analyze rubric categories, does not aggregate feedback patterns, and recommendations are generic rather than differentiated by class level

#### SchoolAI / Brisk Teaching
- **What they do:** AI tools for teachers — generate worksheets, provide student-facing AI tutors, auto-generate feedback
- **Conversational AI:** Student-facing only (tutoring). Teachers get dashboards, not chat
- **Cause analysis:** No. Individual student feedback, not class-wide diagnostic analytics
- **Lesson recommendations:** Generic lesson generation from prompts, not data-driven from assessment performance
- **IEP/504:** Limited — some tools adjust reading level
- **Pricing:** Freemium with paid tiers ($8-15/month per teacher)
- **Gap:** Content generation tools, not analytical tools. Cannot analyze existing grade data, identify causes of low performance, or recommend lessons based on actual student weaknesses

#### EssayGrader / Kangaroos AI
- **What they do:** Bulk AI essay grading with rubric-based feedback
- **Conversational AI:** None
- **Cause analysis:** No. Per-student grades and feedback, no class-wide analysis
- **Lesson recommendations:** None
- **IEP/504:** No
- **Pricing:** Per-teacher subscription (~$10-20/month)
- **Gap:** Pure grading tools. No analytics layer, no chat, no trend tracking, no differentiation

### What Only Graider Does

**1. Diagnostic Cause Analysis**
Every competitor shows *what* the scores are. Graider is the only tool that answers *why* — rubric category breakdowns show which skills are weakest, unanswered question detection reveals which content students skipped, and omission impact analysis quantifies how much leaving sections blank cost them. A teacher can ask "What caused the low grades?" and get: *"Writing quality was the weakest category (avg 8.2/25). 61% of students left at least one section blank, which cost them an average of 13.3 points."*

**2. Data-Driven Differentiated Lesson Recommendations**
No competitor analyzes the actual student work a teacher graded, identifies the specific weaknesses, cross-references the state's curriculum standards filtered by DOK level appropriate to the class level, and recommends what to teach next — differentiated for advanced (DOK 3-4), standard (DOK 1-3), and support (DOK 1-2) periods. That closed loop from *grading → diagnosis → differentiated prescription* does not exist elsewhere.

**3. The Complete Teaching Loop**
The market is fragmented: CoGrader grades essays but has no analytics. Panorama Solara has analytics but doesn't grade. Gradescope helps with grading workflows but has no AI chat. Renaissance does assessment but only standardized tests. **Graider is the only tool where the AI grades the work, extracts structured data, lets you interrogate that data conversationally, and recommends what to teach next — all in one platform.**

**4. Accessible to Individual Teachers**
Panorama Solara requires a district-level contract. Renaissance/i-Ready require institutional procurement. Gradescope requires an institutional license. Graider is available to any teacher with a browser — no IT department approval, no district contract, no procurement cycle.

---

### Why Graider Wins — At a Glance

| Capability | Graider | The Rest of the Market |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Grading** | GPT-4o grades essays, short answers, handwriting (vision) | CoGrader/EssayGrader do essays only; Gradescope does STEM grouping |
| **AI Analytics Chat** | Ask questions in plain English, get data-driven answers | Panorama Solara queries behavior/attendance, not grade data |
| **Diagnostic Cause Analysis** | Rubric breakdowns, omission impact, weakest categories | Nobody — competitors show scores, not causes |
| **Differentiated Lesson Recs** | By class level (advanced/standard/support) + DOK standards | Nobody — Renaissance has generic learning paths |
| **IEP/504 Awareness** | Accommodation-aware grading, feedback, and analytics | Panorama does MTSS tracking; others have nothing |
| **Academic Integrity** | 4-layer detection (AI phrases, style profiling, contrast, history) | Turnitin does plagiarism; none do writing style profiling |
| **Student Progress Tracking** | Historical trends, writing fingerprints, baseline profiles | Renaissance does standardized test trends only |
| **Bilingual Feedback** | Auto-detects language, generates dual feedback (EN + ES) | Nobody in the grading space |
| **Standards Alignment** | FL B.E.S.T. with DOK, essential questions, learning targets | Renaissance aligns to standards but only on their tests |
| **Data Privacy** | Your data on Graider's server — never shared, sold, or aggregated | Multi-tenant cloud, data shared with vendors |
| **Cost** | ~$50/year per teacher | $200-500+/year (or district contracts at $5-15/student) |
| **Accessibility** | Any teacher, any browser, no IT approval needed | Most require institutional procurement |
